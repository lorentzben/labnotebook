#### Module 2

4.1a Sampling Dist of Xbar

4.1b Sampling a normal dist of xbar

4.1c general properites

mean value of xbar is mu

standard deviation is sigma over sqrt of n

when its normal the dist is approximatly normal for any sample size otherwise n>= 30 

4.1 d carbon monoxide

sample size is given, average, sample mean etc

4.1 e bank teller

n does not affect the shape of the population, or the sample.

sampling distribution of the average time a sample of customers spends with the bank teller
since n>=30 sampling dist of xbar will be approx normal. 

4.1f lake acidity

use a normal q-q plot to check normality

need to justify normality before you use the normal distribution to calculate probabilities. 

4.2a one sample t-test

use s not sigma for stdev since we dont know sigma usually. 

sigma is fixed but s varies from sample to sample. 

t has more variation than z 

t curve is still bell shaped but longer tails, this is cause of not knowing the exact standard deviation.

4.2b tribe size 

pop
mean = 5.2
sd = 3 
shape is skewed right

sample

mean = 4.6 
sd = 3.2
shape = ???

sampling estimates population parameters

4.2 c audit part 1

4.2d audit part 2

4.2e nutritional information 

4.2f processing orders

start with H0 and Ha then check conditions: independence and normality

small sample, need to justify the normality of the population then can justify the normality of sample population. Check the q-q normal plot to justify the population and then sample.

4.2g Shapiro Wilk test fro normality

Not for use on large sample sizes, when N is large sampling distribution of  x bar is approx normal. Trying to justify that sample population is approx normal, hope is to fail to reject H0. 

4.2h gum

Homework 4 

- I have a question about question 1c, do you want a p-value calculation, or just hand waving that because xbar is an approximation of mu that it is very unlikely that you would get a 16.75
do I need to justify this with the sample standard deviation (i.e. 16.75-15/0.7071 = 2.47 stdev above the mean between 95 and 99 percent)


- for the last question, we do not have the population stdev so do we just use the z score and a normal approximation?

5.1a curing cancer type 1 and type 2 error

5.1b hospitals part 1

5.1 c hospitals part 2

Proportion of times for rejecting H0 when mu is equal to the xbar

5.1d hospitals part 3

5.1e choosing levels of significance.

5.1g Using JMP to find power.
