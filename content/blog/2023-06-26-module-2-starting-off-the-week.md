#### Module 2

4.1a Sampling Dist of Xbar

4.1b Sampling a normal dist of xbar

4.1c general properites

mean value of xbar is mu

standard deviation is sigma over sqrt of n

when its normal the dist is approximatly normal for any sample size otherwise n>= 30 

4.1 d carbon monoxide

sample size is given, average, sample mean etc

4.1 e bank teller

n does not affect the shape of the population, or the sample.

sampling distribution of the average time a sample of customers spends with the bank teller
since n>=30 sampling dist of xbar will be approx normal. 

4.1f lake acidity

use a normal q-q plot to check normality

need to justify normality before you use the normal distribution to calculate probabilities. 

4.2a one sample t-test

use s not sigma for stdev since we dont know sigma usually. 

sigma is fixed but s varies from sample to sample. 

t has more variation than z 

t curve is still bell shaped but longer tails, this is cause of not knowing the exact standard deviation.

4.2b tribe size 

pop
mean = 5.2
sd = 3 
shape is skewed right

sample

mean = 4.6 
sd = 3.2
shape = ???

sampling estimates population parameters

4.2 c audit part 1
