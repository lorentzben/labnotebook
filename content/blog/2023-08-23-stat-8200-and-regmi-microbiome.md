### Drew

Drew came by asking about some corticosterone data that he is analyzing. The same birds were not sampled each time and there were multiple timepoints. He wanted to be able to do comparisons of treatments at each timepoint to see if the cort levels differed based on the treatment. He had previously been blacking out the days not of interest running the analysis and doing that for each timepoint but was curious if I knew a better way to do it. I suggested setting up a big model which you could subset the days to compare treatment which would work if the same birds were measured and you could use a repeated measures mixed model. But based on that Drew said he would just stick with one by one analysis. I felt dissapointed I couldn't offer a easy answer and felt like he might not want to come to me next time which I don't love, but we will see. Ultimatly I want to be helpful

### Stat 8200

I spent a lot of today reading the notes for class; It was a pretty good review from 6220 and 6221 and then from the material we have been covering in class. It takes a very detail oriented eye to make sure you are speaking about the right thing, but I think I'm getting better at it. More homework to do. 


I also am waiting on the data from Dr. Regmi to start that re-analysis but I can start building the script infastructure in the meantime if needed.
