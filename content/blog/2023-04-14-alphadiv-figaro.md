### Todos for Today

- Class
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
- Ade
  - Is my pairise permanova the same as the pairwise one
  - Beta diversity measurements
  - Cluster to 97% similarity?
  - Examine How SRS changes result vs rarefying
  - Run a proper analysis to send to Ade
  - Mock Community Investigation
  - How does the other Ben's Analysis line up with mine/ampliseq?
    - filtering step for the abundance?
- gg-catalog
  - Generate a gene network 
    - how do you do this?
      - possibly this: https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-3371-7
  - query the KO list and cross ref to the abundance data
  - Find a Shotgun Analysis involved with chickens and some kind of phenotypic data.
- Generate a Mock community M&M or other and validate pipelines
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - benchmark with a mock community

### Ade

#### Check Alpha diversity tests

```bash

#### PERMANOVA post-hoc

Does my method follow the same procedure as the R package I found online?

#### Beta diversity measurments

Are there any other tests I should consider?

#### OTUs at 97% 

Provide the option to Cluster taxa into 97% otus

### Merge Figaro Back to Main

#### SRS vs Rarefy
