### Todos for Today

- gg-catalog
  - better formatted table so that the clarity is better.
  - what ammino acids are being processed in each segment
    - valine is processed in the duodenum but not the jejunum
  - gene network of all keggs in one network for each tissue
  - go into the literature; gene catalogs for a biological process in an organism.
      - Need to compare/remove the common genes/processes 
      
- RFID
  - analyze the new data from Michigan State
    - Check Data integrity from Feb to May
    - Summary stats, days etc.
    - Concat Data
    - Summary
  - Possibly reach out to Drew Arbogast about GPS/network analysis analysis. 

- Look at flight options from ATL to Stockholm Sept 3 to Sept 9th
  - Follow up with Swedes Tomorrow or Thurs
- Possibly help Regmi with picrust from previously analyzed projects. 
 
- Read papers about microbiome analysis

- Look into ggpicrust2 for shailes
  - Possibly meet Shailes on Monday
  
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
  
- Risk management training and quiz

## RFID

### analyze the new data from Michigan State

Check Data integrity from Feb to May

Summary stats, days etc.

We need to find the cross section across all the rooms

room 2 2021-02-01 T20:00:00/2021-05-07 T13:00:00 37
room 3 2021-03-09 T20:00:00/2021-05-07 T14:00:00 31
room 8 2021-02-04 T22:00:00/2021-05-06 T23:00:00 34
room 11 2021-02-18 T23:30:00/2021-05-07 T15:00:00 36

58 days or 87 days but lose one room of 31 samples?


Concat Data

2 analyses: 1 with all rooms 
1 with longer days


Summary

Possibly reach out to Drew Arbogast about GPS/network analysis analysis. 

Need to finish up code, and then write up a report

### Candice Stopped By 

She's working on setting up a 16s analysis of C prefingus in ceca and ilea scraping samples using  a qiagen power fecal kit and was asking about sequencing help since the core said it would take about 6 months. I didn't have any clear recomendations sequencing wise but I gave a brief overview of what kind of analysis you want to setup. I offered to help run the Moving pictures tutorial and teach her some git so that could be helpful in the future.
