### STAT 8200

Homework

I was able to work through more of the homework problems and a lot of them make sense based on the notes that Dr. Hall assigned readings for. The mixup I had was dt vs pt but I think I got those sorted (hopefully) as well as pnorm. I need to just do the proofs and I'm not sure how hard or easy those are gonna be. 

### Dr. Aggrey

Aggrey asked me to help him move and then FTP some files up to NCBI for a publication; I started the process but it will take at least overnight so i'm gonna leave it to run.
