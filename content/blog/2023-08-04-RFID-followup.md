### Todos for Today

- gg-catalog
  - fill in Kegg names
  - Show to Dr. Aggrey

- Meet Dr. Regmi about future data
 
- Read papers about microbiome analysis

- Look into ggpicrust2 for shailes
  - Possibly meet Shailes on Monday
  
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
  
### gg-catalog

I was able to generate all of the table and format them pretty like, but I do not have access to the printer currently so I am waiting on OITs to resolve the issue. 

### RFID

I reopened the F:regmi/RFID_bird_tracking directory and started to look around. I want to re-run the concat_all_the_data analysis, and make sure the code still makes sense, then I can implement a new script with the new data just to keep processes clean. 

We need to start with the individual rooms and then do a global pooled analysis. 

Can we classify the birds based on activity? or use PCA to reduce the dimensionality 

### Meet Abhiack

Dr. Dallou's student Abhiack stopped by my office to ask if I could help train him on microbiome work (which is not related to his greater study but an area of interest). I set him up with starting to look into a conda env of QIIME2 and we will meet next Tuesday to discuss how to run QIIME2. 

### Todos for Next Week

- gg-catalog
  - Show to Dr. Aggrey

- RFID
  - re-examine how I set up the analysis previously
  - analyze the new data from Michigan State
    - Check Data integrity from Feb to May
    - Summary stats, days etc.
  - Possibly reach out to Drew Arbogast about GPS/network analysis analysis. 

- Look at flight options from ATL to Stockholm Sept 3 to Sept 9th
- Possibly help Regmi with picrust from previously analyzed projects. 
 
- Read papers about microbiome analysis

- Look into ggpicrust2 for shailes
  - Possibly meet Shailes on Monday
  
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
