### Todos for Tomorrow:

- Examine all MAGs uncovered
  - Summarize major players in each segment
    - try to join tables from each of these studies from 2023-01-13
  - Summarize gene content in each segment
  - Figure out how to present this to Dr. Aggrey
- Go Back to the Original question from Aggrey (from 8-22-22)
  - Explained to Dr. Aggrey my progress on papers
  - He suggested I begin by characterizing the taxa present in each gut segment
  - Then see what functional data we have for those and see what substrates will make it to the end 
- Generate a Mock community M&M or other and validate pipelines
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - benchmark with a mock community
- Examine some papers collected
