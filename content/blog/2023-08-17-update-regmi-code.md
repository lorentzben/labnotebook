### Todos for Today

- gg-catalog
  - better formatted table so that the clarity is better.
  - what ammino acids are being processed in each segment
    - valine is processed in the duodenum but not the jejunum
  - gene network of all keggs in one network for each tissue
  - go into the literature; gene catalogs for a biological process in an organism.
      - Need to compare/remove the common genes/processes 
      
- RFID
  - Send Regmi the bird IDs by activity level
  - make a duration table for each bird and how long they spend in low medium and high zones; average each bird across the low med high 
  - combine global transition plots series onto one chart. 
 
- Possibly help Regmi with picrust from previously analyzed projects. 
 
- Read papers about microbiome analysis

- Look into ggpicrust2 for shailes
  - Possibly meet Shailes on Monday
  
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation

### RFID

Send Regmi the bird IDs by activity level

- Wierdly my all rooms table does not include room 3, so I am re-running the table build to see if there is an issue with that?

make a duration table for each bird and how long they spend in low medium and high zones; average each bird across the low med high 

combine global transition plots series onto one chart. 

Room 3 was commented out of the code....
So now we need to check the cutoffs for the whole room analysis

update lines 978-989 and then check the output table.

### gg-catalog

Cancel Hotels.
Figure out new plan.
