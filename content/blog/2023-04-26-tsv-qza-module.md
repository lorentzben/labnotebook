### Todos for Tomorrow

- Class
  - Paper?
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
- Ade
  - Make TSVTOQZA a module, and use multiple import
  - Examine How SRS changes result vs rarefying
  - Run a proper analysis to send to Ade
  - Mock Community Investigation
  - How does the other Ben's Analysis line up with mine/ampliseq?
    - filtering step for the abundance?
- gg-catalog
  - Generate a gene network 
    - how do you do this?
      - possibly this: https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-3371-7
  - query the KO list and cross ref to the abundance data
  - Find a Shotgun Analysis involved with chickens and some kind of phenotypic data.
- Generate a Mock community M&M or other and validate pipelines
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - benchmark with a mock community
- Check out https://youtu.be/oBfu3prR5FA
