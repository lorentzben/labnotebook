### Todos for Today

- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
- gg-catalog
  - Zhang
    - check for read loss (does it match the paper?)
      - yes, but Need to confirm with cat samples
    - try out the indexing and mapping steps with BWA
      - rev c60deddafd6ce2b4d8dcc57e0b9301ef046d2f82
    - formula for relative abundance
    - what is involved in clean-up
    - calculate relative abundance for zhang data
  - Huang
    - compare to zhang data
  - Other short read results
- Generate a Mock community M&M or other and validate pipelines
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - benchmark with a mock community
