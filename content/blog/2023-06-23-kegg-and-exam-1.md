#### Exam 1 review questions

I am examining the review videos for exam 1

Assumptions we need to check for hypothesis testing: 

- independence: randomly selected 
- normality of phat: 
  - n*p > 15 n*1-p > 15
  - binomial no

Describe sampling dist 

- mean = p
- SD = sqrt(p 1-p/n) 
- Shape = np > 15 n(1-p) > 15 approx normally distributed 

Formula to calculate z score:

x-mu/stdev
