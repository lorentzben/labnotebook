### Todos for Today

- gg-catalog
  - better formatted table so that the clarity is better.
  - what ammino acids are being processed in each segment
    - valine is processed in the duodenum but not the jejunum
  - gene network of all keggs in one network for each tissue
  - go into the literature; gene catalogs for a biological process in an organism.
      - Need to compare/remove the common genes/processes 
      
- RFID
  - analyze the new data from Michigan State
    - Check Data integrity from Feb to May
    - Summary stats, days etc.
  - Possibly reach out to Drew Arbogast about GPS/network analysis analysis. 

- Look at flight options from ATL to Stockholm Sept 3 to Sept 9th
  - Follow up with Swedes
- Possibly help Regmi with picrust from previously analyzed projects. 
 
- Read papers about microbiome analysis

- Look into ggpicrust2 for shailes
  - Possibly meet Shailes on Monday
  
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
  
### RFID

I updated room 2 and room 3

One note was to make sure that the matrix is using the proper n-rows since without that, the number of transitions gets messed up. I had to re-gen the room 2 code because of that but we are good now. 

### Microbiome Meeting

He was not really prepared for our meeting, the qiime conda env was just being installed when he showed up, so we talked a little bit about some steps I emphasized reading the text around the tutorial and not just blindly running commands. I also suggested asking about sapelo2 access since if you want to run your own data you will need to have access, it will be too slow on a local machine.
