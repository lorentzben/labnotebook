### Todos for Next Week:

- Examine all MAGs uncovered
  - Summarize major players in each segment 
  - Summarize gene content in each segment
  - Figure out how to present this to Dr. Aggrey
- Go Back to the Original question from Aggrey (from 8-22-22)
  - Explained to Dr. Aggrey my progress on papers
  - He suggested I begin by characterizing the taxa present in each gut segment
  - Then see what functional data we have for those and see what substrates will make it to the end 
- Generate a Mock community M&M or other and validate pipelines
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - benchmark with a mock community
- Examine some papers collected

I want to take a three-proned approach:

- I want to examine the taxa and functions uncovered by using the shotgun reads
- I want to examine the taxa and possibly the suggested function using the 16s reads
- I want to examine what taxa are present using cultured methods. 

I feel like the truth will end up somewhere in the middle of these three approaches.
