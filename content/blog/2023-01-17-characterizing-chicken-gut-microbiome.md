### Todos for Today:

- Examine all MAGs uncovered
  - Summarize major players in each segment 
  - Summarize gene content in each segment
  - Figure out how to present this to Dr. Aggrey
- Go Back to the Original question from Aggrey (from 8-22-22)
  - Explained to Dr. Aggrey my progress on papers
  - He suggested I begin by characterizing the taxa present in each gut segment
  - Then see what functional data we have for those and see what substrates will make it to the end 
- Generate a Mock community M&M or other and validate pipelines
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - benchmark with a mock community
- Examine some papers collected

I want to take a three-pronged approach:

- I want to examine the taxa and functions uncovered by using the shotgun reads
- I want to examine the taxa and possibly the suggested function using the 16s reads
- I want to examine what taxa are present using cultured methods. 

I feel like the truth will end up somewhere in the middle of these three approaches. 

### Zhang MAGs

First can we talk about the results they produced and then if needed we can go back to the raw data. It seems like GTDB-TK is the gold standard when it comes to assigning taxonomy to MAGs so I think that is a good procedure for right now, unless we want to pull out 16s sequences and use amplicon strategies with those?

### Meeting with Ben Jackwood

We went over the code line-by-line to examine how it works and answer questions so that he is able to write the research note as well as answer questions for future students. We then reviewed the few comments I had regarding the write-up regarding language and accuracy of the steps that were performed. He said that he was going to discuss the paper with Dr. Jordan and then, if needed, get back to me. 

### Todos for Tomorrow:

- Examine all MAGs uncovered
  - Summarize major players in each segment
    - try to join tables from each of these studies from 2023-01-13
  - Summarize gene content in each segment
  - Figure out how to present this to Dr. Aggrey
- Go Back to the Original question from Aggrey (from 8-22-22)
  - Explained to Dr. Aggrey my progress on papers
  - He suggested I begin by characterizing the taxa present in each gut segment
  - Then see what functional data we have for those and see what substrates will make it to the end 
- Generate a Mock community M&M or other and validate pipelines
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - benchmark with a mock community
- Examine some papers collected
