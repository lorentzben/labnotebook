### Todos for Today

- Finalize Homework 3
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
- Ade
  - Run the same analysis with the Negative Controls to get out ahead of it. 
  - Meet with Dr. Ade
- gg-catalog
  - Generate a gene network 
    - how do you do this?
      - possibly this: https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-3371-7
  - query the KO list and cross ref to the abundance data
  - Find a Shotgun Analysis involved with chickens and some kind of phenotypic data.
- Generate a Mock community M&M or other and validate pipelines
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - benchmark with a mock community

### Meet With Dr. Ade

#### Questions I have for him 

Basically, we want to run the negative control data through and the positive control, then we can compare the abundances of the positive vs the expected (which we need from Dr. O) and then we can run an ANOVA type test to see if NC looks like our data or not. 

I did not process the negative control samples, I can process them but I need a little bit more information. 

- How were these Negative Controls constructed?
- What library was used for the positive controls?
