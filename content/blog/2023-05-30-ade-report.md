### Todos for Today

- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
- Ade
  - compare fastp and prinseq analyses
  - How does the other Ben's Analysis line up with mine/ampliseq?
    - filtering step for the abundance?
    - Filtering unknown taxa?
  - Run a proper analysis to send to Ade
    - Create Report
      - NC
      - Mock Quality
      - Why SRS?
  - Longitudinal Analysis By hand
- gg-catalog
  - Generate a gene network 
    - how do you do this?
      - possibly this: https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-3371-7
  - query the KO list and cross ref to the abundance data
  - Find a Shotgun Analysis involved with chickens and some kind of phenotypic data.
  
### Ade

#### Fastp vs Prinseq analysis

#### Ben's Other analysis

What steps did he take?

- 

What steps do I take?

-

#### Report for Dr. Ade

- update the TODO #TODO save these contams to disk so we can examine them in contam_script.r
- understand how good the mock community analysis is
- Describe the difference between SRS and Longitudinal analysis



#### Longitudinal Analysis

See if it makes a difference in this specific analysis.
