### Stat 6315

9.1a types of association, correlation coefficient

- Two Quantitative Variables -> make scatterplot to compare them 
Form, Linear, quadratic, exponentail
Direction, positiv negative, up down

Positive Association
no association

Correlation is a statistic that is used to quantify the variability and its linearity

r positive positive linear relationship
r negative negative linear relationship
Have to be careful with the correlation coeffecient, measures the strenght of the linear relationship

1. get to scatterplot first
2. then get correlation coeffecient

- may be a relationship just not linear

9.1b education and crime rate part 1

Explanitory Variable -> X
Response Variable -> Y

negative linear association

r will be negative because the scatterplot shows a negative association

no it is not a perfect relationship 

it is a weak negative linear relationship

9.1c education and crime rate part 2

Get equation

slope is equal to change in one unit

this is an average amount the crime rate will change

slope= change in y / change in x  

for every 1 percentage point increase in those with a high school diploma, crime rate is predicted to decrease by 170.58 on the average. 

9.1d Florida Election Recount

Palm Beach county

positive linear association
