### Todos for Today:

- Generate a Mock community M&M or other and validate pipelines
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - benchmark with a mock community
- Examine some papers collected

### Generate Mock Community

Jeff Gordon seems like one of the pioneers in [gut microbiome research](https://gordonlab.wustl.edu). 
His (selected) Research Questions:
  - What are the genomic and metabolic foundations of our relationships with beneficial gut microbes? 
  - Can we intentionally and durably change the properties of our gut microbial communities (microbiota) to improve health?
How the lab answers those questions:
  - sequencing of gut microbial community DNA as well as the genomes of cultured microbial (primarily bacterial) members of the human gut community, 
  - whole genome transposon mutagenesis of cultured human gut bacterial strains to identify fitness determinants in vitro and in gnotobiotic animal models,
  - RNA-Seq and targeted mass spectrometry-based analyses of the responses of members of the microbiota to dietary and other perturbations applied to our gnotobiotic animal models
  - assays of metabolic flux, energy balance, innate and adaptive immune responses, bone biology, and CNS metabolism/functional connectivity in our preclinical models
  
From [Uchicago news](https://news.uchicago.edu/explainer/how-microbiome-affects-human-health-explained): 

One big problem with microbiome research:

"All of this research might give the impression that if disruptions of the microbiome lead to disease, one could treat those same diseases by restoring a “healthy” microbiome. That’s the ultimate goal, but many of the early links between the microbiome and health are just correlations—that is, researchers catalogued differences the microbiome of healthy people and those with a disease, but don’t yet understand the details. We still have much to learn about the specific mechanisms and types of microbes that lead to these disruptions."

From [Poultry World](https://www.poultryworld.net/health-nutrition/core-metagenomic-functions-of-the-poultry-microbiome/):

"Nitrogen utilisation pathways control the degradation and biosynthesis of peptides. Amino acids synthesised by the microbiome can be absorbed by the bird to increase effective protein availability. In animal production, adverse protein fermentation may generate excess ammonia, biogenic amines, and nitrogenous toxins that degrade barrier function, trigger inflammation, reduce welfare and increase environmental impact."

There is a ftp:// ftp.agis.org.cn/~fanwei/Chicken_gut_metagenome ftp server that houses the gene catalog of all the genes from the chicken observed.
