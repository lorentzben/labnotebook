  - meet with Ben to talk about two points above 2/2/23
- gg-catalog
  - Zhang
    - followup on slurm-18160757
    - create a minimap process (either concat or separate)
      - create a channel/process for each screening reference
    - check for read loss (does it match the paper?)
    - formula for relative abundance
    - what is involved in clean-up
    - calculate relative abundance for zhang data

### Jackwood Blast Parser

1. Email Ben Jackwood back

#### add in isolate column to results

### gg-catalog-nf

#### compare of minimap results from joined and individual runs

### Homework 1 

#### Go over every calculation 

Go over each question and re-calculate all of the results, and then check f-val as well as p-value to ensure correct results.
