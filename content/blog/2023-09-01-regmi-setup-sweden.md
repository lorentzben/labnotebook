### Todos for Today

- class
  - Complete homework 1 problems
    - re-run early analysis with t-test/aov
  
- other sweden tasks
  - find a copy of Regmi Data to be able to show them
  - Make sure Space on Macbook
  - Make Sure space on essd
  
- Regmi
  - RFID
    - Create a plot that shows the average amount of time each bird spends in a zone
    - Send to Regmi
  - Microbiome Work
    - Make script to get from raw data to QZAs
    - Compile all params I'm gonna need
    - Make a doc to import data into:
      - QIIME2
      - Phyloseq
      -biopython
  - Heat Stress
    - Re-Run the heat stress analysis to see what the results look like
    - New subset with 9-5/6pm
    - Is there a better way to analyze this type of data
      
- gg-catalog
  - better formatted table so that the clarity is better.
  - what ammino acids are being processed in each segment
    - valine is processed in the duodenum but not the jejunum
  - gene network of all keggs in one network for each tissue
  - go into the literature; gene catalogs for a biological process in an organism.
      - Need to compare/remove the common genes/processes 

 
- Read papers about microbiome analysis

- Look into ggpicrust2 for shailes
  - Possibly meet Shailes on Monday
  
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
  
### Class

I need to finish Lab 1 and double check Homework 1

### Sweden Tasks

I cleared up some space on my interal hard drive ~ 40gb and on my work drive ~400 gbs

### Regmi

Meet with Regmi

RFID

Regmi wants me to re-generate the duration plots, to look at the time in each zone; I am going to go back into the code and re-make those plots with the average time. He needs the tightened up plots by 9/13 for certain. 

Heat Stress Turkey

When I get back from Sweden Dr. Regmi wants me to re-perform the heat stress analysis I did previously, but to shift the window of heat stress from 8-4 to 9-5/6 and repeat. 

I also want to take a copy of this data to Sweden and ask if anyone has experience in temporal analysis, the cyclic circadian type data. 

Microbiome Data analysis

I double checked what Dr. Regmi wants to do with the data in relation to Hari (sp?). He said that he would be interested in him learning how to process the raw data, I said regmi should look into getting him Sapelo2 access. I am going to put the analysis on the backburner a little bit to be able to focus on some other stuff until I get back.
