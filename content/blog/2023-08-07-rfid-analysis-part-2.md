### Todos for Today

- gg-catalog
  - Show to Dr. Aggrey

- RFID
  - re-examine how I set up the analysis previously
  - analyze the new data from Michigan State
    - Check Data integrity from Feb to May
    - Summary stats, days etc.
  - Possibly reach out to Drew Arbogast about GPS/network analysis analysis. 

- Look at flight options from ATL to Stockholm Sept 3 to Sept 9th
- Possibly help Regmi with picrust from previously analyzed projects. 
 
- Read papers about microbiome analysis

- Look into ggpicrust2 for shailes
  - Possibly meet Shailes on Monday
  
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
  
### gg-catalog

- what is the takeaway from the tables I've Made
- make a easier to read printout to show Dr. Aggrey

A quick meeting with Dr. Aggrey to show him the tables I have constructed. He wanted me to have the phrase " a catalog of genes associated with microbial function in gut of chickens"

he wants the table to be better formatted so that the clarity is better.

He wants a better understanding of what ammino acids are being processed in each segment
  - valine is processed in the duodenum but not the jejunum
  
He wants a gene network of all keggs in one network for each tissue (this might be a big undertaking but we will generate it).

He wants me to go into the literature and see what kind of gene catalogs for a biological process in an organism. 

Need to compare/remove the common genes/processes so that we can compare what is different in each tissue. 

### RFID analysis

- Make new scripts for RFID analysis

Generated new script up to line 339, need to update downstream.
  
- Small writeup for new results.
