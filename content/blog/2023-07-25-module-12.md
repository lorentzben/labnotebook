### STAT6315

12.1a variation

ANVOA is comparison of several means, one variable with multiple categories (one contiuous response)

generalization to more than two populations of the pooled t-test procedure

H0 means are equal
Ha at least two differ; not all means differ

k population or treatment is normally distributed 
identical standard deviaitons
indepenedence within groups
random samples independent of eachother, not matched pairs

similar assumptions to two sample t-test

not matched pairs
independence within groups
normality
constant variance

F = Variation between groups/Variation within groups

use an F dist for the probability

the smaller the variation, the less the difference between the groups need to differ

Fit the one-way ANOVA

check conditions:
constant variance
normality 
independence

determine if there's enough evidence

no stop
yes pairwise comparisons

12.1b donations part 1

explanitory type of approach

response is contribution ammount

Parameters:

muA: mean contribution for approach A
muB:mean contribution for approach B
muC:mean contribution for approach C

H0: muA = muB = muC
Ha: at least two means differ

variation in contributions is approx same?
yes, the IQR is similar for the three approaches

mean contributions differ sig?
yes, the mean contribution for approach B will probably be higher than approach A and C but approaches A and C will probably not differ significantly. 

12.1c donations part 2

independent groups:
not matched pairs, each sponsor was assigned to only one treatment

independence within groups:
the sponsors were randomly assigned to the treatment groups

normality:
based on the linear pattern of the normal quantile plot of the residuals, the normality condition is plausible 

constant variance:
variance for group a = variance for group b = variance for group c
at least two variances differ

guard against a type II error (hoping to reject)
alpha of 0.1

the brown-foresythe p-value is 0.8246 which is bigger than 0.1 this indicates the constant variance condition is plausible.

ANVOA F = 9.4096
p-value = 0.0012

Reject H0 there is enough evidence to conclude the mean contribution is different for at least two approaches. 

a point estimate of the common standard deviation is Root Mean Square Error = sqrt(MSE)
269.09

12.1d spark plugs part 1

H0: mu1 = mu2 = mu3 = mu4 
Ha: at least two means differ 

total number of observations: 5*4 = 20 

df total = 20-1 = 19

df treatment = # means - 1 = 4-1 = 3
df is additive, df treatment + df error = df total

df error = 19-3 = 16

Sums of squares are additive

sum sq treatment + sum sq error = sum sq total

ms treatment = sum sq treat/df treat = 75081.72/3 = 25027.24

ms error = sum sq error/df error = 235419.04/16 = 14713.69

if we ignored the fact that there are four different brands of spark plugs, the sample variance would be S^2 = sum(y-ybar)^2/n-1 = (310500.76)/19 = sum square/df

12.1d spark plugs part 1

ms treatment is an estimate of the variation between the groups
ms error is an estimate of the variation within the groups 

a point estimate for the common standard deviation is the sqroot(mean sq error) = \sqrt(14713.69) = 121.3

ybara +/- t\* \times Ssuba/sqrt(5)
df = 5 -1 = 4

ybara +/- t\* \times 121.3/sqrt(5)
df = 16

F = test statistic = ms treatment / ms error = 25027.24/14713.69 = 1.701

p-value = area to the right of the test statistic 1.701 = 0.2069

there is not enough evidence to conclude the mean number of miles is different for at least two brands of spark plugs. 

12.2a resins

after you reject H0, then you start to wonder about pairwise comparisons. 

alpha 0.05, reject H0 there is enough evidence to conclude the mean concentration of impurities is different for at least two resins.

check to see if zero is in the interval?

12.2b simulation

are the samples coming from a population with the same mean?

Type I rejecting when H0 is true
Type II failing to reject when H0 is false

alpha = P(type I error)

multiple t-test results in higher than expected type 1 error rate.

12.2c Bonferroni Method

4C2 = 4!/2!\*(4-2)! = 6

1-(1-0.05)^(1/6)

12.2d fruit flies part 1

H0: mu1 = mu2 = mu3 = mu4
ha at least two means differ

independent groups the male fruit flies were assigned to only one treatment group; not matched pairs

independence within group the 125 male fruit flies were randomly assigned to the companion groups

normality: the histogram of residuals is unimodal and symmetric and the normal quantile plot has a linear pattern; these indicate the normality condition is plausible

constant variance: The B-F p-value is 0.7419 > 0.1 the constant variance condition is reasonable.

F=13.6120 p-value < 0.0001

Reject H0 there is enough evidence to conclude the mean longevity of male fruit flies is different for at least two companion groups.
