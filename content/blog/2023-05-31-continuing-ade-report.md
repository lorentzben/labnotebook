### Todos for Today

- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
- Ade
  - compare fastp and prinseq analyses
    - examine slurm 23044970
  - How does the other Ben's Analysis line up with mine/ampliseq?
    - filtering step for the abundance?
    - Filtering unknown taxa?
  - Longitudinal Analysis By hand
  - Email Dr. Ade
- gg-catalog
  - Generate a gene network 
    - how do you do this?
      - possibly this: https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-3371-7
  - query the KO list and cross ref to the abundance data
  - Find a Shotgun Analysis involved with chickens and some kind of phenotypic data.
