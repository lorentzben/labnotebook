### Todos for Today

- Class
  - if there are any paper edits
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
- Ade
  - Finish SRS implement:
     - test 4 options
  - Taguchi optmization for richness?
  - Make these subworkflows as opposed to one long workflow?
  - Unit tests based on the example data
  - Positive Control Analysis
  - Examine How SRS changes result vs rarefying
  - Run a proper analysis to send to Ade
  - Mock Community Investigation
  - How does the other Ben's Analysis line up with mine/ampliseq?
    - filtering step for the abundance?
    - Filtering unknown taxa?
- gg-catalog
  - Generate a gene network 
    - how do you do this?
      - possibly this: https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-3371-7
  - query the KO list and cross ref to the abundance data
  - Find a Shotgun Analysis involved with chickens and some kind of phenotypic data.
- Generate a Mock community M&M or other and validate pipelines
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - benchmark with a mock community
