### Class

Practice Exam

I copied down both the problems and answers, and I think it helped me catch the issues I was missing on the first pass. That might be a good theory for the true exam. (which I will do after lunch)

Exam 1

32 Questions 90 Minutes. 

We wrapped it up with a 91%, good job Ben!

### Sweden

I completed my peer review and submitted it. 


### RFID

I need to make a function to generate the day and nights time budgets.
