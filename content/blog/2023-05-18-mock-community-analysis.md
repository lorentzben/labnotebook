### Ade

#### Positive Control Analysis

First step is to collect the sequences for the mock community:

I had to make an account and agree that I was not going to re-distribute the sequences

from qiime: 

```md 

### Evaluating quality of samples with known composition

Mock communities consist of known microbial strains that are intentionally mixed at defined proportions, such that the composition of the sample is known. Mock communities are useful for benchmarking bioinformatics methods, e.g., to determine how well a given method or pipeline estimates the expected composition. Many investigators also include mock communities or other samples with known compositions on sequencing runs to determine run quality and method optimization on a per-run basis. The q2-quality-control plugin contains two actions to assess mock community accuracy in each of these use cases. evaluate_composition assesses the accuracy with which the expected taxonomic composition (or other feature composition) is reconstructed. evaluate_seqs assesses the similarity of observed sequences to expected sequences, e.g., to determine the accuracy of denoising or OTU picking methods, and is described in the next section.

evaluate_composition compares the feature composition of pairs of observed and expected samples containing the same sample ID in two separate feature tables. Typically, feature composition will consist of taxonomy classifications or other semicolon-delimited feature annotations. Letâ€™s give it a spin.


qiime quality-control evaluate-composition \
  --i-expected-features qc-mock-3-expected.qza \
  --i-observed-features qc-mock-3-observed.qza \
  --o-visualization qc-mock-3-comparison.qzv

Output visualizations:

    qc-mock-3-comparison.qzv: view | download

Taxon accuracy rate, taxon detection rate, and linear regression scores between expected and observed feature abundances are calculated at each semicolon-delimited rank, and plots of per-level accuracy and observation correlations are plotted. A histogram of distance between false positive observations and the nearest expected feature is also generated, where distance equals the number of rank differences between the observed feature and the nearest common lineage in the expected feature. Finally, lists of false positive (misclassified and underclassified) and false negative features are given at the bottom of the visualization. Misclassifications are features that do not match any expected features at the deepest level of classification (e.g., species level), and usually represent either sample contaminants or sub-optimal bioinformatics pipelines (e.g., the presence of chimeric sequences or the use of an overconfident taxonomic classifier). Underclassifications are observed features that match expected features, but are not classified to the expected taxonomic depth (e.g., they are only classified to genus level but that genus classification is correct); these are often valid features (i.e., not contaminants) but are not classified to the desired level either because of technical limitations (e.g., sequences too short), degraded sequence quality, or sub-optimal methods (only a poor carpenter blames his/her tools, but one tool can do better than another). False negatives are features that were expected to be observed, but were not; these can be compared to the false-positives to get an idea of what features may have been mis-/underclassified.

### Evaluating sequence quality

evaluate_seqs aligns a set of query (e.g., observed) sequences against a set of reference (e.g., expected) sequences to evaluate the quality of alignment. The intended use is to align observed sequences against expected sequences (e.g., from a mock community) to determine the frequency of mismatches between observed sequences and the most similar expected sequences, e.g., as a measure of sequencing/method errors. However, any sequences may be provided as input to generate a report on pairwise alignment quality against a set of reference sequences.

qiime quality-control evaluate-seqs \
  --i-query-sequences query-seqs.qza \
  --i-reference-sequences reference-seqs.qza \
  --o-visualization eval-seqs-test.qzv

Output visualizations:

    eval-seqs-test.qzv: view | download

This visualization shows the alignment results for each query sequence, the number of mismatches between expected and observed sequences, and finally pairwise alignments between each query sequence and its closest match among the reference sequences (if --p-show-alignments is set). This ouptut is still quite basic, but is planned for expansion in the near future. Keep your eyes peeled!
```

So we have two steps we can try:

1. See how good the sequences were generated

We just need to import the sequences as qza and then align representative sequences against them, but I don't think this is what we want to do?

2. See how good the analysis was performed

Fake an abundance table:
[wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/master/data/mock-25/unite/7-1/99-otus/expected-taxonomy.tsv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/master/data/mock-25/unite/7-1/99-otus/expected-taxonomy.tsv)

and then import it

If we apply this one the correct way, then we can benchmark the pipeline with a tool like Mockrobiota

#### New issue for Visualize-Ampliseq

We need to re-generate the rooted tree, from [qiime2forum](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/should-i-filter-out-my-mock-community/10238/7):

```md
Not needed. You can take your existing feature-table and rep-seqs.qza file that you got from Deblur or DADA2 and work from there.

    Filter the samples you want from your feature table using the filter-sample 11 plugin.
    Use the new filtered table to remove sequences from your rep-seqs.qza file with the filter-seqs 8 plugin.
    Then you can build your new tree with this new rep-seqs file. You can also use the fragment-insertion plugin for tree building.

In the future, if you just want to exclude some samples from your feature-table you can either a) use the filtering options I mentioned above or simply make a new metadata file with those samples removed. With that regards, any downstream tests you do will just draw from those samples only and ignore the rest. Some tests even let you choose specific groups within your metadata file.
```

```

So we are having an issue with filtering the sequences we should go back and use the steps outlied by the qiime forum:

```md

You can take your existing feature-table and rep-seqs.qza file that you got from Deblur or DADA2 and work from there.

    Filter the samples you want from your feature table using the filter-sample 11 plugin.
    Use the new filtered table to remove sequences from your rep-seqs.qza file with the filter-seqs 8 plugin.
    Then you can build your new tree with this new rep-seqs file. You can also use the fragment-insertion plugin for tree building.
```
