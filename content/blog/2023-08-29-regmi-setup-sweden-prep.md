### Todos for today

- Regmi
  - Microbiome Work
    - Make script to get from raw data to QZAs
    - Compile all params I'm gonna need
    - Make a doc to import data into:
      - QIIME2
      - Phyloseq
      -biopython
 
- other sweden tasks
  - github etc
  - get info from them
  - find a copy of Regmi Data to be able to show them 
  
- class
  - Complete homework 1 problems
    - re-run early analysis with t-test/aov
  
- gg-catalog
  - better formatted table so that the clarity is better.
  - what ammino acids are being processed in each segment
    - valine is processed in the duodenum but not the jejunum
  - gene network of all keggs in one network for each tissue
  - go into the literature; gene catalogs for a biological process in an organism.
      - Need to compare/remove the common genes/processes 

- Read papers about microbiome analysis

- Look into ggpicrust2 for shailes
  - Possibly meet Shailes on Monday
  
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
  
### Sweden

  I worked on writing my blob for who I am and what I'm researching. I also put together my slide for the presentation. I needed to render the rnotebook file to pdf so that I could get n and the cutoffs for the datetime.  
  
### Bird Stress

Regmi got me the raw data from collaborators and I am workign on getting it downloaded its 7.7gb but it keeps failing out. 
I then need to follow the analysis that was done previously.
I want to benchmark my nextflow implementation against the other one since I have a step by step analysis.
