<p>I wanted to find a little bit more elegant method to keeping notes from my various
analyses. This notebook should hopefully help with this all. I am interested to
see how it grows and evolves.</p>
<p>So far today I have worked on understanding the process of setting up, and rendering
a blogdown document and pushing it up to the hosting server. As well as implementing
a theme from GitHub. I think that this a stable enough solution to move forward with.</p>
<p>Other Tasks for today:</p>
<ul>
<li>watch lecture for class for Thursday</li>
<li>check in on the ALDEx2 Analysis document to send to Shailes when itâ€™s done
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lorentzben/picrust2_shailes/commit/0ab89731173cf12d527517328967c6fe9753621a">Link to commit</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
