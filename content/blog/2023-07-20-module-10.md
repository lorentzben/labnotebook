### Todos for Today

- Make up TAP forms for Dr. Aggrey to sign
- Read papers about microbiome analysis
- STAT 6315
  - Watch all module 10 videos:
    - multiple regression 
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
- gg-catalog
  - Implications of the networks generated
  - How does KEGG work?
  - Show Aggrey the charts and ask him what he thinks
  - Find a Shotgun Analysis involved with chickens and some kind of phenotypic data.
  - Some kind of machine learning classifier to determine major players in a phenotypic outcome.

### STAT 6315

10.2f supervisor performance part 2

Check conditions for:
  - Hypothesis test
  - Confidence interval
  
Do not Need to for:
  - Proportion of the variation explained (R^2)
  - Interpreting coefficients
  
Conditions:

  - Independence
  - Normality
  - Mean Zero Condition
  - Constant variance
  
H0: all betas are equal and equal to zero 
Ha: at least one beta is not equal to zero

F = 9.5336  P-value <0.001

There is enough evidence to conclude the model with all six predictor variables is useful for predicting overall job rating being done by the supervisor. 

H0: beta4 = 0
Ha: beta4 !=0

F= 1.10 p-value= 0.284

given the other 5 predictors are in the model there is not enough evidence to conclude raises based on performance is a useful predictor of overall rating of supervisor. 

failed to reject h0 so CI 95% will contain 0
(-0.219, 0.712)

with all other predictors fixed, for every one unit increase in raises based upon performance, we can be 95% confident the overall rating of job being done by supervisor decreases by as much as 0.219 or increases by as much as 0.712. 

10.3a coffee sales part 1

Negative association, but probably not linear

- normality
- mean zero 
  - Clearly there is a pattern in the residual plot which means that the mean zero condition is not satisfied. 
- constance of variance

Sales hat = intercept + coef \*(temp) + coef \* (temp^2)
            32.96       1.69            -0.02
            
R^2 = 0.9879

98.78% of the variation in sales has been explained by fitting the quadratic model with temperature as the predictor variable

10.3b coffee sales part 2

if temperature increases from 56 to 57 how much is sales affected?

sales hat if temp =56 = 58.18
sales hat if temp = 57 = 57.37

sales is predicted to have decreased by 0.81 cups on the average.

sales hat if temp =74 = 36.78
sales hat if temp = 75 = 35.17

F= 1307.48 p-value < 0.001

There is enough evidence to conclude the quadratic model with temperature as the predictor variable is useful for predicting coffee sales. 

10.3c flares

indicator variable 0/1

forumulation A = intercept beta 0

form b = beta0 + beta1

beta0 = beta0 + beta1

beta1 = 0

H0 beta1=0 Ha beta1 !=0

reject H0 there is enough evidence to conclude the mean burn time is different for these two formulations. 

pooled t-test agree with the regression, compare means and constant variance, compare two independent means. Could not use this with a paired t-test.
