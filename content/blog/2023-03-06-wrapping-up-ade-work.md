### Ade Work

#### Turn bioms into TSVs

### Ben Jackwood

Ben came by to ask what amount of computing power we would need to run the whole blast and then parser pipeline. I suggested we test a local blast query to see if it is memory or processor limited. I also suggested he and Brian look into a NAS or other data vault type solution. 

### Regmi

Dr. Regmi came by to ask about how to start going about training a new student in microbiome work and if there's a class. I suggested he start with rosalind and then build into the moving pictures tutorial for QIIME2, and then that I built a pipeline to analyse and visualize the results. He also suggested that Dr. Fairchild has a Sr level undergrad course where you go out into houses and processing sites, or that he is teaching a welfare course in the springs that would be good to audit for some background.
