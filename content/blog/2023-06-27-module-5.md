#### Module 2 Homework 5

5.2a bears part 1

sample size large approx norm, even though appears skew left.
2.8361 standard errors below the hypothesized mean length (65)
there is a 0.0076 chance of obtaining a sample of 35 bears in which the average body length is 59.42 or more extreme assuming the true mean is 65

5.2b bears part 2

true length 60, to detect we would reject H0 

detect power,

alpha 0.05
sd 11.64 sig or s
dif to detect 5 65-60
n = 35

DOE, diag, power

5.2c soap part 1

H0 mu = 33 Ha mu < 33

type 1 concluding is enough evidence the mean count is less than 33 when it is not 
type 2 concluding there is not enough evidence the mean count is less than 33 when it is

reject H0 with a value of 30.66 or smaller

5.2d soap part 2

power beta and alpha distributions are all interlinked

5.2e Jury Duty part 1

it is proportions so we use p not mu

biased against, less than mean

5.2f Jury Duty part 2

Homework 4

How do you determine this question? 

In a sample of 18 rhesus monkeys, what is the probability that one-third have a weight of less
than 13.5 pounds?
