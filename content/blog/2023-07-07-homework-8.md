### Admin Tasks

Can you rsync video up to youtube? This is good practice to keep my rsync skills sharp for transfering large files onto or off of servers. 

So rsync isn't an option but you are able to use python and the google API to upload I found two ways:

1. https://github.com/tokland/youtube-upload
2. https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/uploading_a_video

They both use the API 1 is just a client written around it so that it is nicer to interact with, but if its broke, we can write our own using the google API
