### Admin Tasks

Can you rsync video up to youtube? This is good practice to keep my rsync skills sharp for transfering large files onto or off of servers. 

So rsync isn't an option but you are able to use python and the google API to upload I found two ways:

1. https://github.com/tokland/youtube-upload
2. https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/uploading_a_video

They both use the API 1 is just a client written around it so that it is nicer to interact with, but if its broke, we can write our own using the google API

### Stat 6315

#### Homework 8

Submitted and re reviewed homework 8. 

#### Review homework 4-8

I went through and marked up documents for homework 4
homework 5
homework 6
and homework 7 ( I don't have the solution yet but I noticed a mistake)

I found a lot more errors than Zheng marked so I am greatful for that, but I also did make a ton of stupid mistakes. I need to be really careful for the Exam 2.

#### Exam 2 Review Prep

problem 1-5 completed.
