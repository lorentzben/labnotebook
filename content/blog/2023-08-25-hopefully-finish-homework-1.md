### Stat 8220

HW 1 
  I have been working on problem 6 for most of today. I have two last sections of it and I went into class today.


### Sweden

I got this email earlier today


Dear course participant, 
The Animal Movement GitHub repository is now public: Please take a quick look and see what you find there. You will need a GitHub account to download the repository directly to R studio, although it can also be downloaded from the web. After the course, we will close the repository and only you as a course participant will access it.
 
Prior to the course, you should spend 1 to 2 hours on the intro exercise available on the GitHub page at ./scripts/sep4_session2_afternoon/AM_IntroExercise.Rmd . You find the data for the exercise on the GitHub repository in the data folder (as described in the exercise). Any of these exercises that you are not able to solve we will go through together on the first day of the course, and of course, if you have any queries about this introductory exercise just send me an email. 
 
Im going into the town hall meeting (hopefully from 4 to 5).
