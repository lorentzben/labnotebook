### Todos for Today

- gg-catalog
  - functionalize the dictionary generation and then the turning that into a more info table
  - apply it to each tissue and pathway combination
  - Select top 25 most abundant genes from these tables
  
 
- Read papers about microbiome analysis

- Look into ggpicrust2 for shailes
  - Possibly meet Shailes on Monday

- STAT 6315
  - Take exam 3 on Thursday
  
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
  
### gg-catalog

currently, we have average relative abundance by tissue, this is the main thing we are working off of. Next step is to filter these Rabundances by pathways and while doing that keep track of the genes that hit off of those keggs in the pathways and then we will be able to build up the whole table i think. 

TODO functionalize the kegg_gene_names dict and more info tables.
