### Todos for Today:

- Go Back to the Original question from Aggrey (from 8-22-22)
  - Explained to Dr. Aggrey my progress on papers
  - He suggested I begin by characterizing the taxa present in each gut segment
  - Then see what functional data we have for those and see what substrates will make it to the end 
- Generate a Mock community M&M or other and validate pipelines
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - benchmark with a mock community
- Examine some papers collected
