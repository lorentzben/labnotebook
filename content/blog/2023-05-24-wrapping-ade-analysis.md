### Todos for Today

- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
- Ade
  - Mock Community Investigation
  - How does the other Ben's Analysis line up with mine/ampliseq?
    - filtering step for the abundance?
    - Filtering unknown taxa?
  - Run a proper analysis to send to Ade
- gg-catalog
  - Generate a gene network 
    - how do you do this?
      - possibly this: https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-3371-7
  - query the KO list and cross ref to the abundance data
  - Find a Shotgun Analysis involved with chickens and some kind of phenotypic data.

### Ade

#### Picking proper parameters

In report 01, I want to double check the headines to make sure they are correct, and not right up against anything

Table 3 Note this is to the least rich sample, not the final analysis. 

Table 4 Note, this is from the proper rardepth, so like 3 but updated and only diversity.

Report 05 check how the adjusting p-value make sense

Who was filtered out of the negative control analysis?



What was the accuracy of the mock analysis?

#### Ben's Other analysis

What steps did he take?

What steps do I take?



#### Longitudinal Analysis
