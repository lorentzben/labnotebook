### Todos for Today

- gg-catalog
  - better formatted table so that the clarity is better.
  - what ammino acids are being processed in each segment
    - valine is processed in the duodenum but not the jejunum
  - gene network of all keggs in one network for each tissue
  - go into the literature; gene catalogs for a biological process in an organism.
      - Need to compare/remove the common genes/processes 
      
- RFID
  - analyze the new data from Michigan State
    - Check Data integrity from Feb to May
    - Summary stats, days etc.
    - Room 8
    - Room 11
    - Concat Data
    - Summary
  - Possibly reach out to Drew Arbogast about GPS/network analysis analysis. 

- Look at flight options from ATL to Stockholm Sept 3 to Sept 9th
  - Follow up with Swedes Tomorrow or Thurs
- Possibly help Regmi with picrust from previously analyzed projects. 
 
- Read papers about microbiome analysis

- Look into ggpicrust2 for shailes
  - Possibly meet Shailes on Monday
  
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
  
- Risk management training and quiz
  
### RFID


## analyze the new data from Michigan State

Check Data integrity from Feb to May

Summary stats, days etc.

Room 3

- does it really start in march?

Room 8

is feb 5 throwing away too much data?

updated

Room 11

can start at 02/01 or 02/18 to keep a couple more samples
