### Todos for Today

- gg-catalog
  - Identify KEGG pathways that deal with Protein Metabolism/Nitrogen metabolism
  
- Read papers about microbiome analysis

- STAT 6315
  - Watch Module 13
  - Finish Module 13 Homework
  
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
 
### gg-catalog

Based on the meeting on Monday (7-24) we need to find the list of Keggs who have to do with protien degradation, I think the best goal would be to start with [this map](https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ko04974) and follow it from crude protein to products. 

There are 20 amino acids, humans can generate 11 of them but 9 must be consumed through diet, they are the essential amino acids. [source](https://www.healthline.com/health/protein-digestion)

- all amino acids synthesized in humans are derived from the intermediates in glycolosis, the citric acid cycle or pentose phosphate pathway [source](https://www.slideshare.net/SonaliGadge3/amino-acid-pathway)

Two important enzymes are amylase and lipase, though they mostly break down carbohydrates and fat, I am curious to see if they break down ammino acids at all? [source](https://www.healthline.com/health/protein-digestion)
