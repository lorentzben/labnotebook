### RFID

Something seems broken in the timeToInterval function, Day+Night is not equal to overall so I want to build some test data to evaluate my functions. 

Okay so is the identify unique even doing anything???

It is identifying some records as duplicates but its also missing some.

Can we remove it since we are alreay using the check later?

to convert epoch to human read

```excel
=(((B5/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)
```

We have a bunch of cases to finish, my throat is feeling sore so I'm gonna head home
