### Todos for Today

- Make up TAP forms for Dr. Aggrey to sign
- Read papers about microbiome analysis
- STAT 6315
  - Watch all module 10 videos:
    - multiple regression 
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
- gg-catalog
  - Implications of the networks generated
  - How does KEGG work?
  - Show Aggrey the charts and ask him what he thinks
  - Find a Shotgun Analysis involved with chickens and some kind of phenotypic data.
  - Some kind of machine learning classifier to determine major players in a phenotypic outcome.

We found out our room number (0327) sharing with Ben Jackwood and Drew Callahan which will be nice I guess from the collaboration aspect and I liked having my own space so we'll see how that all goes I guess.
