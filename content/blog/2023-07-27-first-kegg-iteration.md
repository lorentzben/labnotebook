### Todos for Today

- gg-catalog
  - Identify KEGG pathways that deal with Protein Metabolism/Nitrogen metabolism
  
- Read papers about microbiome analysis

- Reply to Shailes 

- STAT 6315
  - Watch Module 13
  - Finish Module 13 Homework
  
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
  
### Admin Tasks

Reply to Shailes -> I want to try one last thing to analyze the data before sending to him.

I opened up STAMP to take a look and I think that I was able to set up the analysis to compare what he wants to examine. We should look at the manual together to determine which tests are appropriate. 

This could be a very interesting package to examine too

### gg-catalog

Currently, we have the most abundant keggs across all pathways of interest selected. Next we might want to subset the tables for each tissue by pathway so we can look one-by-one. This might mean more blocks in the 04 code. 

### Todos for Tomorrow

- gg-catalog
  - Make Tissue, then Pathway, then gene specific tables
  - Select top 25 most abundant genes from these tables
 
  
- Read papers about microbiome analysis

- Look into ggpicrust2 for shailes

- STAT 6315
  - Watch Module 13
  - Finish Module 13 Homework
  
- Jackwood Blast
  - meet Ben and Brian TBD
  - try out a local blast search to see memory, cpu time limitation
