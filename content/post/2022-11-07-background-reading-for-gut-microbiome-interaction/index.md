### Todos for Today:

- continue reading Tillocca
- continue reading jones
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - add example params and slurm for ampliseq into ampliseq-vis repos
- Run Visualize Ampliseq
  - on low med high richness samples
- re-watch the lecture for ChIP-seq
- What is a core microbiome?
  - Can we use this to find the major players in chicken gut segments?
  - are keystone species more important in gut microbiomes?
- How can multi-omics projects be implemented in host-microbe interactions
- Check in on classifier still running

---

- Try to run DESeq2’s GLM/LRT on shaile’s design
- Learn a little more about GLM in R

---

- BIOSQL, SQL or Mongo DB tutorials
- Genome Assembly from Isolates
- Kelly Shotgun Metagenomic Data
- good example 16s data to hone parameters

The temptation for today is to dig really deep into visualizing the 3 richness depths, but I want to put that off for just a little bit while I try to read some more papers today to start to get ahead on that to have some more information to report to Aggrey soon. A third task that would also be good to dig into would be running one of my tissues for the term paper.
