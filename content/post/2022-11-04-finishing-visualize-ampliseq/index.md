### Todos for Today:

- continue reading jones
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - add example params and slurm for ampliseq into ampliseq-vis repos
  - Report chunk 11-14
- re-watch the lecture for ChIP-seq
- What is a core microbiome?
  - Can we use this to find the major players in chicken gut segments?
  - are keystone species more important in gut microbiomes?
- How can multi-omics projects be implemented in host-microbe interactions
- Check in on classifier still running

---

- Try to run DESeq2’s GLM/LRT on shaile’s design
- Learn a little more about GLM in R

---

- BIOSQL, SQL or Mongo DB tutorials
- Genome Assembly from Isolates
- Kelly Shotgun Metagenomic Data
- good example 16s data to hone parameters


Today's Goal is to finish the Report generator for Visualize Ampliseq. One of the largest issues I see is incorporating Lefse since we may need to generate some other intermediate files but we will only know for certain once we get into it! If we finish that early, then we can either peek into the 3 runs (low, med, high richness)[low priority], read some papers that we have saved in Zotero, or Spend some time on section three tasks (database, genome assembly, etc.)
