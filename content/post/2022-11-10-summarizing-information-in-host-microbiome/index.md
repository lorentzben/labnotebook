### Todos for Today:

- Tillocca
  - look at references and see if we can get a generalized taxa table
  - from the taxa table functionally annotate the 'role' of the taxa present in each segement
    - they may have done some of this heavy lifting for us.
- site for microbiome
  - ingest Zou
- continue reading jones
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - add example params and slurm for ampliseq into ampliseq-vis repos
- Run Visualize Ampliseq
  - on low med high richness samples
- re-watch the lecture for ChIP-seq
- What is a core microbiome?
  - Can we use this to find the major players in chicken gut segments?
  - are keystone species more important in gut microbiomes?
- How can multi-omics projects be implemented in host-microbe interactions
- Check in on classifier still running

---

- Try to run DESeq2’s GLM/LRT on shaile’s design

---

- BIOSQL, SQL or Mongo DB tutorials
- Genome Assembly from Isolates
- Kelly Shotgun Metagenomic Data
- good example 16s data to hone parameters
- read reviews from Tilocca

Today I want to finish ingesting the documents and then summarize each page's information. I know we will be working on my term paper later today during class time. I should also at least download Shailes' data to see what it looks like. Finally we should look at the results from visualize ampliseq 2.
