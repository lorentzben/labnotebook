### Todos for Today:
- Term Paper
  - Collect reference genome and annotations
- continue reading jones
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - Refine chunk 06
  - add example params and slurm for ampliseq into ampliseq-vis repos
- nf-core/Ampliseq
  - compare low, medium, high richness results
- re-watch the lecture for ChIP-seq
- What is a core microbiome?
  - Can we use this to find the major players in chicken gut segments?
  - are keystone species more important in gut microbiomes?
- How can multi-omics projects be implemented in host-microbe interactions
- Check in on classifier still running

- Shaileâ€™s compare flip/flop and reply to his email

---

- BIOSQL, SQL or Mongo DB tutorials
- Genome Assembly from Isolates
- Kelly Shotgun Metagenomic Data
- good example 16s data to hone parameters


Today I want to check out the multi qc results for my term-paper analysis, as well as understand how to run a GLM type model for DE data to be able to get back to Shailes.
