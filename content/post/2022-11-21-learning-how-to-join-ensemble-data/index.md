### Todos for Today:

- Figure out if we can compare GALG and GALT in any meaningful way
- Check in on Medium Richness analysis
- re run HTSeq and quantify 
- Run the data through DESeq after samtools(?) or alignment.
- Tillocca
  - look at references and see if we can get a generalized taxa table
  - from the taxa table functionally annotate the 'role' of the taxa present in each segment
    - they may have done some of this heavy lifting for us.
- continue reading jones
- Re-Run the low med high analyses
  - Run Visualize Ampliseq
    - on low med high richness samples
- re-watch the lecture for ChIP-seq
- Check in on classifier still running

---

- BIOSQL, SQL or Mongo DB tutorials
- Genome Assembly from Isolates
- Kelly Shotgun Metagenomic Data
- good example 16s data to hone parameters
- read reviews from Tilocca

### Term paper 

#### Can we join GALG and GALT?

Is there a way to turn these into gene names?

#### STAR results

Did the first sample go through star this time?


### Visualize Ampliseq

#### Check in Medium Richness Analysis 

### Host Microbiome Analysis
