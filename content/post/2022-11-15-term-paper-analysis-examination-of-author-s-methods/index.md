### Todos for Today:

- talk to Casey in person about analysis and how to write the words part about a flub
- Run the data through DESeq after samtools(?) or alignment..
- Update Visualize ampliseq to use the correct channel
- Tillocca
  - look at references and see if we can get a generalized taxa table
  - from the taxa table functionally annotate the 'role' of the taxa present in each segment
    - they may have done some of this heavy lifting for us.
- continue reading jones
- Re-Run the low med high analyses
  - Run Visualize Ampliseq
    - on low med high richness samples
- re-watch the lecture for ChIP-seq
- What is a core microbiome?
  - Can we use this to find the major players in chicken gut segments?
  - are keystone species more important in gut microbiomes?
- How can multi-omics projects be implemented in host-microbe interactions
- Check in on classifier still running

---

- BIOSQL, SQL or Mongo DB tutorials
- Genome Assembly from Isolates
- Kelly Shotgun Metagenomic Data
- good example 16s data to hone parameters
- read reviews from Tilocca

First order of today is to collect Sleuth results from the teaching cluster, then do a quick analysis of the members identified and how they are related to the results the author found (from supp tables 6-10). Then follow the analysis from class using Hisat2. Then seeing if we can emmulate their results. We should also make sure we are taking some good notes. 

Then we need to update the visualize ampliseq pipeline to include the correct channels.
