### Todos for Today:

- write weely update for Gene 8940
- Tillocca
  - look at references and see if we can get a generalized taxa table
  - from the taxa table functionally annotate the 'role' of the taxa present in each segement
    - they may have done some of this heavy lifting for us.
- continue reading jones
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - add example params and slurm for ampliseq into ampliseq-vis repos
- Run Visualize Ampliseq
  - on low med high richness samples
- re-watch the lecture for ChIP-seq
- What is a core microbiome?
  - Can we use this to find the major players in chicken gut segments?
  - are keystone species more important in gut microbiomes?
- How can multi-omics projects be implemented in host-microbe interactions
- Check in on classifier still running

---

- rebuild docker image to include deseq2 
- Try to run DESeq2’s GLM/LRT on shaile’s design

---

- BIOSQL, SQL or Mongo DB tutorials
- Genome Assembly from Isolates
- Kelly Shotgun Metagenomic Data
- good example 16s data to hone parameters
- read reviews from Tilocca

Priories, today I want to rebuild the shailes picrust docker container and implement the DESeq2 differential expression methods. Then while that's building I want to update my github issue for the week (I should look at my notes from this site to see if there is any good information to include). Then I want to examine the Stork documents that I have received this week.
