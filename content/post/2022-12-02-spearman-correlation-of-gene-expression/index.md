### Todos for Today:

- Term paper
  - confirm that the SRRs remain consistently linked from Kallisto on
  - generate full count tables for each tissue from Sleuth
  - generate full count tables for each tissue from DESeq2
  - link gene id's to transcript ids
  - run spearman's correlation on log2 fc based on gene ID
  - Write Results Section for Term Paper
  - Weekly update
- Visualize Ampliseq (STALE)
  - examine slurm run 15474870
  
  
### Term Paper

#### Make all gene tables

#### Compare gene ids from sleuth and deseq2

#### Run spearman correlation on log2fold change

### Visualize Ampliseq
