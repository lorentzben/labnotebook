Todo's from Friday:

- Rebase Report-01 based on microbiome analyst
  - store a copy of the current stacked bar with tax.clean function in it
  - Figure out how to install and pick a version to pin
  - Build a docker image
  - determine general appropriate stacked bar
  - implement
- Work on Homework 3 for class (Genome Assembly)
- Check in on ALDEx2 Analysis
- Check in on Classifiers and their generation.


### Installing Microbiome Analyst

Note when looking into NF-Core stuff they suggest the heriachy to be Bioconda -> someone else's docker image -> (last resort) making your own docker image. And if I remember correctly Microbiome analyst is 1. still under development 2. only available through GitHub. This also means we need to pick a version/commit that we want to be pinned to.
