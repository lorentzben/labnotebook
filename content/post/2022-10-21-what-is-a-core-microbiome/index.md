### Todos for today:
- Wrap Up Homework 4
  - Check the BCF tools intermediates
  - Run Mpileup without the quality filter
  - Write up the words part of the section
- What is a core microbiome?
  - Can we use this to find the major players in chicken gut segments?
- Look into genomic type project for class (see project description)
  - Reach out to Dr. Aggrey to see if he approves of idea or has an alternative.
- Understand how sampling depth is determined for ampliseq
- Implement chunk 06
- Check in on classifier still running

I feel like I have been putting the Aggrey science review material on the side to work on the pipeline, Jackwood Shailes' works, and coursework. So I think I want to dig into it a little bit today. 

First up though is going to be finishing homework 4 so that I can make sure it is submitted and good to go. 

I also feel like I should look into how ampliseq determines depth and see if that is easy to determine or if it is a large task for next week.
