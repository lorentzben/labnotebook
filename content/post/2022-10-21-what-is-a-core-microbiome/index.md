### Todos for today:
- Wrap Up Homework 4 ***Done***
  - Check the BCF tools intermediates
  - Run Mpileup without the quality filter
  - Write up the words part of the section
- Reply to Shailes
- What is a core microbiome?
  - Can we use this to find the major players in chicken gut segments?
- Look into genomic type project for class (see project description)
  - Reach out to Dr. Aggrey to see if he approves of idea or has an alternative.
- Understand how sampling depth is determined for ampliseq
- Implement chunk 06
- Check in on classifier still running

I feel like I have been putting the Aggrey science review material on the side to work on the pipeline, Jackwood Shailes' works, and coursework. So I think I want to dig into it a little bit today. 

First up though is going to be finishing homework 4 so that I can make sure it is submitted and good to go. 

I also feel like I should look into how ampliseq determines depth and see if that is easy to determine or if it is a large task for next week. 

### Homework 4

I want to make sure that my filtering steps make sense. The first command is the mpileup command, I want to compare the output file with and without the -q 60 flag. This would include reads with a mapping quality lower than 60. 

So the number of lines decreased by about 60,000 features, out of 4 million features so I think that that makes sense. The filter command seems to be pretty straightforward. 

One last thing is to double check Bergman's class notes. Everything looks good from here. 

### Organize the Notes from Class

I want to make sure I have my notes packaged up and onto the NAS so that I don't lose access to them. 
Downloaded and working on uploading to the server. 

### Reply to Shailes

I want to reply to Shailes because I think we can easily run his data through. The one question/issue I have is that I still cannot articulate the significance of the intercept. I want to do ~30 min of reading before I reply so that I feel informed enough to speak on it.
