Todos for Today:
- continue reading jones
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - Refine chunk 06
  - add example params and slurm for ampliseq into ampliseq-vis repos
- nf-core/Ampliseq
  - compare low, medium, high richness results
- re-watch the lecture for ChIP-seq
- What is a core microbiome?
  - Can we use this to find the major players in chicken gut segments?
  - are keystone species more important in gut microbiomes?
- How can multi-omics projects be implemented in host-microbe interactions
- Check in on classifier still running

---

- Try to run DESeq2's GLM/LRT on shaile's design
- Learn a little more about GLM in R

---

- BIOSQL, SQL or Mongo DB tutorials
- Genome Assembly from Isolates
- Kelly Shotgun Metagenomic Data
- good example 16s data to hone parameters


I think we should spend like 2 sections of a pom on general GLM and then if we aren't getting far then we can pivot to examining the results from ampliseq, and report 06/ the rest in that batch. Then we can work on outlining the project description for my term paper.
