### Term Paper

#### Script 9

slurm:
revision:

```bash

```

#### Writing Methods

I need to go through the methods section and script by script state what they are doing and version numbers and revisions.

#### Writing results

how many genes were in authors, how many were in sleuth, how many were in deseq2?

go through each result and outline where they are and what the significance is. 

#### What I would expand on or improve

I want to make a table highlighting the number of genes and how many common genes were found and how many were lost

There is a possibility the metadata on NCBI was uploaded incorrectly. One way I could examine to see if this is the case is to run a PCA on the DEGs to see if the samples from each alleged tissue cluster together, and therefore 

### Visualize Ampliseq.

TBD
