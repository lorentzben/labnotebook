### Todos for Today:

- Set up google scholar alert for:
  - broiler microbiome
  - layer microbiome
  - genetics gallus
  - rna seq poultry
  - multi-omics poultry
  - 16s rRNA and poultry
  - shotgun sequencing poultry
  - host-microbiome interaction and poultry.

- Watch lecture for class Tuesday.
- Look into genomic type project for class (see project description)
  - Where did they suggest we get data from for Dr. Bensasson and Dr. Leebens-Mack's Class
  - Reach out to Dr. Aggrey to see if he approves of idea or has an alternative.
- Understand how sampling depth is determined for ampliseq
- Implement chunk 06
- What is a core microbiome?
  - Can we use this to find the major players in chicken gut segments?
- How can multi-omics projects be implemented in host-microbe interactions
- Check in on classifier still running
