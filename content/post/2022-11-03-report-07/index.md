Today I want to get some good momentum with visualize ampliseq. I know that I will slow down when class time comes, especially since I must finish my project proposal today during class. If there is overflow time too then I can also start my analysis of one of the tissues. I have a feeling that the analysis will be pretty straight forward to run, the long part will be making sense out of my results. I think two types of result will be good to examine. 1: Did I recover the same number/type of DEG as the original paper? 2: What trends do my DEG point to?
