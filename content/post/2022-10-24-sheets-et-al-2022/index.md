### Abstract
Despite the negative impacts of Salmonella intestinal colonization on human health, Salmonella is a natural colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract and is not overtly pathogenic to the avian host. It is of interest to understand the impacts and colonization rates of Salmonella across selected genetic lines such as slow-growing (SG) and conventional (CONV) broilers. The objective of this study was to characterize the relationship between Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium challenge and selected broiler genetic lines on the ileal and cecal microbiome. Male chicks of two broiler breeds ( n = 156/breed) were cohoused in an open floor pen until day 7. On day 13, the chicks were then separated into 12 isolators per breed (4 rooms, 6 isolators/room, 11 chicks/isolator). On day 14, chicks in the 12 treatment isolators (6 isolators/breed, 108 total) were challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) (1 × 10 8 CFU/ml) via oral gavage while the remaining chicks ( n = 108) were given an oral gavage of sterile tryptic soy broth control (C). Ileal and cecal contents were collected on day 7 from 24 chicks of each breed, and on days 13, 17, 21, and 24 from two chicks per isolator. Samples underwent DNA extraction and PCR amplification to obtain 16S rRNA amplicons that were sequenced with Illumina MiSeq. Salmonella Typhimurium colonization in the cecum was not different in the two broiler breeds. The main effect of breed had the greatest impact on the ileum microbiota of broilers 7 days of age where SG broilers had significantly lower diversity and richness compared to CONV broilers ( p &lt; 0.05). Salmonella Typhimurium challenge consistently caused a change in beta diversity. Regardless of day or intestinal location, challenged broilers had many amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with decreased abundance of likely beneficial bacteria such as Mollicutes RF39, Shuttleworthia , Flavonifractor , and Oscillibacter compared to broilers that were unchallenged with Salmonella Typhimurium ( p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, there was a difference in the timing of when the microbiota alpha and beta diversity of each breed responded to Salmonella Typhimurium challenge. Thus, both broiler breed and Salmonella Typhimurium can impact the intestinal microbiota.

"The use of antimicrobials, the lack of genetic variability, and limited living space may all contribute to the colonization of poultry by Salmonella in commercial farms (Foley et al., 2011)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IKCZZF7S?page=2) )

"Concurrently, due to increased public concern for animal welfare, there is increased public interest in poultry products from slow-growing chickens. These broilers have been bred through less intensive genetic selection leading to slower growth and longer periods to reach market weight. Studies have shown that such breeds allow for better welfare outcomes, but as expected, there are differences in growth and efficiency when compared to conventional fast-growing broilers (Torrey et al., 2021)" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IKCZZF7S?page=2) )

"The role of broiler host genetic factors in resistance and immune response when exposed to Salmonella has been studied previously.

"This is because the microbial community of the gastrointestinal tract plays a role in extracting energy from nutrients as well as harboring potential pathogenic organisms such as Campylobacter, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens that can colonize and cause illness to the avian host and humans (Clavijo and Flórez, 2018)" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IKCZZF7S?page=9) )

"On the other hand, conventional broilers in the current study were found to have a single amplicon sequence variant of Oscillibacter, Lachnospiracea NK4A136, and Ruminococcus gauvreauii that were differentially abundant in the ileum on day 7. Both Oscillibacter and Lachnospiracea NK4A136 are short chain fatty acid producers while Ruminococcus gauvreauii may be involved with feed efficiency (Madigan-Stretton et al., 2020)."

"Along with genetics and age, it was found that challenge with Salmonella Typhimurium caused community shifts in alpha and beta diversity in both the ileum and cecum. Beneficial microbes such as Mollicutes RF39, Shuttleworthia, Ruminiclostridium 9 and Flavonifractor were found to be decreased in the intestinal tract of challenged broilers in the cecum on day 17, the ileum on day 21, and in both intestinal locations on day 24. Flavonifractor is positively correlated with body weight and average daily gain in broilers given Bacillus subtilis as a probiotic (Zhang et al., 2021). Shuttleworthia may also contribute to nutrient absorption because it contributes to carbohydrate and lipid metabolic pathways (Chen et al., 2020).
