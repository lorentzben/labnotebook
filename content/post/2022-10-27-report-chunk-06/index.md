I am feeling like I'm running through molasses right now, I think I need to examine some pretty easy to achieve tasks today to get some wind back in my sails. TAP is going to be one and I found the sampling depth determiner, I also think I want to re-submit the job with a higher quality cutoff for dada2 to see if that is causing issues, followed by examining fastqc results to see if something else is more apparent.
