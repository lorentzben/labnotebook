Todo for today:

- Start on Report 02
- Check in on classifier still running
- Make up cheat sheet for QIIME2 and Phyloseq

Yesterday we were able to get nextflow verison 0.1 up and running, today the goal is to just get report 02 to run, that's all! If we get past that, it would be awesome.

I was going back and forth on if we should just leave graphan/lefse as a later project, but it is a good exercise in implementing DSL1 code into DSL2. This is also a larger bit to chew off today. 

I also think for either 03 or whichever has the sequence stats, I want to pull in the ampliseq table that they generate that shows what sequences you lose along the way.
