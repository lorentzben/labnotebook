### Todo for today:

- Watch lecture for Thursday
- Make report 01 work through the nextflow platform.
- Start on Report 02
- Check in on classifier still running
- Make up cheat sheet for QIIME2 and Phyloseq

Currently, I have a Rmd file that can render stacked bar plots inside the lorentzb/microbiome_analyst:1.1

Next steps:
- add script into nextflow script
- copy over metadata file 
- copy over item of interest
- Update paths in report 01
- Test full implementation
