### Todos for Tomorrow:

- When is TAP due?
- Look into classes for the Spring semester
- lecture for Thursday.
- continue reading jones
- Understand how sampling depth is determined for ampliseq
- Implement chunk 06
- What is a core microbiome?
  - Can we use this to find the major players in chicken gut segments?
  - are keystone species more important in gut microbiomes?
- How can multi-omics projects be implemented in host-microbe interactions
- Check in on classifier still running
- Collect reference genome and annotations.
- Shaileâ€™s compare flip/flop

I want to, after watching the lecture for tomorrow, look into the ampliseq depth selection. After that I want to follow up on the multi qc analysis for my data.
