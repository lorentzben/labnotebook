### Todos for Today:

- Visualize Ampliseq (STALE)
  - examine slurm run 15474870
- Host microbiome interaction
  - new paper
  
### Tasks for the next 1.5 weeks

- Tillocca
  - look at references and see if we can get a generalized taxa table
  - from the taxa table functionally annotate the 'role' of the taxa present in each segment
    - they may have done some of this heavy lifting for us.
- continue reading jones
- re-watch the lecture for ChIP-seq

---

- BIOSQL, SQL or Mongo DB tutorials
- Genome Assembly from Isolates
- Kelly Shotgun Metagenomic Data
- good example 16s data to hone parameters
- read reviews from Tilocca
