### Todos for Today:

- Tillocca
  - look at references and see if we can get a generalized taxa table
  - from the taxa table functionally annotate the 'role' of the taxa present in each segement
    - they may have done some of this heavy lifting for us.
- site for microbiome
  - fix paragraph links
  - add doi links to citation pages
- continue reading jones
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - add example params and slurm for ampliseq into ampliseq-vis repos
- Run Visualize Ampliseq
  - on low med high richness samples
- re-watch the lecture for ChIP-seq
- What is a core microbiome?
  - Can we use this to find the major players in chicken gut segments?
  - are keystone species more important in gut microbiomes?
- How can multi-omics projects be implemented in host-microbe interactions
- Check in on classifier still running

---

- Try to run DESeq2’s GLM/LRT on shaile’s design

---

- BIOSQL, SQL or Mongo DB tutorials
- Genome Assembly from Isolates
- Kelly Shotgun Metagenomic Data
- good example 16s data to hone parameters


I want to refine the citation files to use the obsidian linking format and that there is a DOI for each citation. Following that we have to digest the Tillocca data, then either 1) dig into their supplementals, 2) look at each richness for visualize ampliseq and make some observations, 3) Implemenet DESeq2 on Shailes' data.
