### Todos for Today:

- Tillocca
  - look at references and see if we can get a generalized taxa table
  - from the taxa table functionally annotate the 'role' of the taxa present in each segement
    - they may have done some of this heavy lifting for us.
- site for microbiome
  - find better index page
  - continue to migrate data from synology dir to the ssd one and push
- continue reading jones
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - add example params and slurm for ampliseq into ampliseq-vis repos
- Run Visualize Ampliseq
  - on low med high richness samples
- re-watch the lecture for ChIP-seq
- What is a core microbiome?
  - Can we use this to find the major players in chicken gut segments?
  - are keystone species more important in gut microbiomes?
- How can multi-omics projects be implemented in host-microbe interactions
- Check in on classifier still running

---

- Try to run DESeq2’s GLM/LRT on shaile’s design

---

- BIOSQL, SQL or Mongo DB tutorials
- Genome Assembly from Isolates
- Kelly Shotgun Metagenomic Data
- good example 16s data to hone parameters

I want to finish website migration, Then Finish importing and synthesizing Tillocca, find taxa table from Tillocca references, then maybe Shailes data, and finally during class time start one tissue analysis. 

### Host Microbiome Interactions Website

I was able to get the website set up pretty close to the format I want to start with. One improvement might be the sections part in like citations etc, but that is something we'll have to figure out a little later. We also must update all of the links to make sure they lead to the correct location and add DOI links for the papers cited. Then we also need to make sure all the citations are digested into the proper sections. The updated page is [here](https://lorentz-host-microbe-interaction.netlify.app/).

### Term Project

I am going to log into class to have some work-partners while I get a tissue analysis set up.
