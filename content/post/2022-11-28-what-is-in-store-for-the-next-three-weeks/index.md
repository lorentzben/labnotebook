### Todos for Today:

- Examine htseq-count results slurm 32753
  - do we have to use --stranded reverse
- rebuild the supplemental tables 1-5 with my results
- Run DESeq2 analysis on htseq-count table
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - examine slurm run 15474870
  

### Todos for the next 3 weeks

- Tillocca
  - look at references and see if we can get a generalized taxa table
  - from the taxa table functionally annotate the 'role' of the taxa present in each segment
    - they may have done some of this heavy lifting for us.
- continue reading jones
- re-watch the lecture for ChIP-seq

---

- BIOSQL, SQL or Mongo DB tutorials
- Genome Assembly from Isolates
- Kelly Shotgun Metagenomic Data
- good example 16s data to hone parameters
- read reviews from Tilocca
