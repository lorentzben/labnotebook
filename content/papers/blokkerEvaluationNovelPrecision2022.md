### Abstract
This study evaluated the supplementation of a precision biotic (PB) on the enterohepatic health markers and growth performance of broiler chickens undergoing an enteric challenge. In the first study, three treatments were used: Unchallenged Control (UC); Challenged Control (CC; dietary challenge and 10× dose of coccidia vaccine); and a challenged group supplemented with PB (1.3 kg/ton). In the second study, three treatments were used: control diet, diet supplemented with Avilamycin (10 ppm), and a diet supplemented with PB (0.9 kg/ton). All the birds were exposed to natural challenge composed by dietary formulation and reused litter from a coccidiosis positive flock. In Trial 1, PB decreased ileal histological damage, increased villi length, and the expression of SLC5A8 in ileal tissue versus CC; it reduced ileal expression of IL-1β compared to both UC and CC treatments. PB increased the expression of cell cycling gene markers CCNA2 and CDK2 in the ileum compared to CC. In Trial 2, PB improved the growth performance, intestinal lesion scores and intestinal morphology of broiler chickens. These results indicate that birds supplemented with PB are more resilient to enteric challenges, probably by its action in modulating microbiome metabolic pathways related to nitrogen metabolism and protein utilization.

"These results indicate that birds supplemented with PB are more resilient to enteric challenges, probably by its action in modulating microbiome metabolic pathways related to nitrogen metabolism and protein utilization." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7FFP34YL?page=1) )

"The first is the existence of core microbiome pathways for energy, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism across microorganisms [6]. The second is the recognition that these core microbiome pathways are highly conserved, even across diverse populations of individuals." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7FFP34YL?page=2) )

"The latter property lies in stark contrast to taxonomic composition (e.g., the gut microbial profile), which often varies significantly across a population of otherwise similar individuals [7]. These insights suggest that targeting core microbiome pathways, rather than working to adjust the microbial profile, offers the potential for improved consistency [4]."

"One strategy for developing PB is by screening tailored glycans for their ability to modulate selected microbiome pathways across a diverse set of microbial communities [8,9]. Glycans provide a chemically diverse class of molecular structures known to exhibit a wide array of bioactivities on microbial communities [10,11]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7FFP34YL?page=2) )

"For example, many prebiotics, such as those obtained from plant fiber, pectins, and other agricultural sources (including those obtained by partial enzymatic hydrolysis), are not developed to target selected metagenomic functions." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7FFP34YL?page=2) )

"In contrast to many prebiotics and probiotics used in animal nutrition, the potential of PB is their ability to activate core microbial pathways to achieve consistency, rather than by modulating the abundance of microbial taxa that vary from animal to animal [12]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7FFP34YL?page=2) )

"The immune system is a notable example of the symbiotic relationship between the host and its microbiome, where the normal immune development and function of the host depends on a diverse array of microbial metabolites produced from dietary and host substrates and synthesized de novo by the microbiota [13]" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7FFP34YL?page=2) )

"normal immune development and function of the host depends on a diverse array of microbial metabolites produced from dietary and host substrates and synthesized de novo by the microbiota" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7FFP34YL?page=2) )

"This close symbiotic relationship has given way to the idea of the holo-biont, as an organism composed of the host and its microbiome [14]. However, when this symbiotic relationship is disturbed by enteric infections, such as coccidiosis in broiler chickens, the use of PB to redirect microbial metabolic functions may be an important nutritional strategy to minimize the negative impact of such infections." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7FFP34YL?page=2) )

"Therefore, the objective of the present studies was to evaluate the effects of a PB, selected for its ability to increase the metabolic output of propionate and butyrate biosynthesis pathways and modulate amino acid degradation and amine metabolism, on enterohepatic health markers of broiler chickens using an intestinal inflammation model. Additionally, the growth performance of broiler chickens raised in commercial conditions undergoing a natural enteric challenge was evaluated."

"The intestinal inflammation model consisted of a challenge diet containing rapeseed meal and potato protein (Table 1) to induce intestinal inflammation due to the presence of antinutritional components [15] and was supplied to treatments B and C from day 8 to 28."

"Goblet cells were identified by Alcian Blue staining, imaging, and villi isolation, after which the number of blue pixels per villus was counted" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7FFP34YL?page=5) )

"For each villus, the density of goblet cells was calculated by dividing the number of blue pixels by the total number of pixels in the corresponding villus.

"In total, 360, 1-day-old male broiler chicks (Ross 308) were assigned in a completely randomized design with 3 dietary treatments, 8 replicates per treatment, and 15 birds per replicate. The treatments were either a basal diet (Table 5) without any additives as control, the basal diet supplemented with antibiotic growth promoter (Avilamycin at 10 ppm), or the basal diet supplemented with 0.9 kg/ton of PB. Diets were formulated to meet Ross 308 nutritional recommendations and prepared in three phases: starter (1-10 days), grower (10-24 days), and finisher (25-28 days; Table 5)."

"In the current study, the intestinal inflammation model applied (nutritional plus 10 coccidiosis vaccination) induced clear villi damage in the histology analysis, leading to a reduced percentage of goblet cells and the mean villi length in ileal mucosa compared to the UC treatment (Figure 1). However, the dietary supplementation of PB to challenged birds increased both goblet cell counts and villi length compared to the CC treatment, to similar levels as UC, indicating less damage of the villi tips in this group."

"Among other target genes evaluated in the ileal mucosa, two genes (NaP IIb (SLC34A2) and the peptide transporter PepT1 (SCL15A1)) were downregulated in the CC treatment compared to the UC (Figure 1), but they were not different from the CC when the birds were supplemented with PB."

"In general, it was observed that broiler chickens supplemented with a PB and undergoing a controlled intestinal inflammation model imposed by nutritional challenge and high dose of coccidiosis vaccination (Trial 1) showed an improved intestinal morphology, improved expression of nutrient transporter genes, lower expression of IL-1, and lower plasma concentration of AGP."

"Even though the present study did not evaluate changes in the mucosal or luminal bacterial communities, the selection of PB as a microbiome metabolic modulator targeting short chain fatty acid (SCFA) and nitrogen microbial pathways would suggest that this effect was driven by shifts in microbiome metabolism and metabolites that could affect the expression of immune-related genes to enhance intestinal morphology; however, this effect needs to be evaluated in further in vivo studies."
