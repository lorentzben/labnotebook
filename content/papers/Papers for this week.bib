  abstract = {Salmonella enteritidis is a foodborne pathogen that causes high morbidity in poultry. Proteomic analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to study the effects of Salmonella infection on spleen proteome in broiler chickens. Day-old broilers were assigned to control (CON; n = 60) or Salmonella challenge (CON−SE; n = 60), and gavaged with Tryptic soy agar broth or SE. A subset of chicks was euthanized on D3 and D7 (n = 4/group/day) and the spleen was removed, and rapidly frozen, subsequently proteome was measured using label-free LC-MS/MS. Protein spectra were mapped to Gallus gallus Uniprot database. Differentially abundant proteins (DAP; FDR {$<$} 0.05) between days and treatments were identified using ANOVA. Cecal content of Salmonella in CON−SE was 3.37 log10 CFU/g and CON were negative. Across the 16 samples, 2625 proteins were identified. Proteins that decreased in abundance between days mediated cell cycle progression, while those that increased in abundance function in cytoskeleton and mRNA processing. SE infection caused an increase in proteins that mediated redox homeostasis, lysosomal activities, and energy production, while proteins decreased in abundance-mediated developmental progression. Proteomic signatures of spleen suggest SE infection was metabolically costly, and energy was diverted from normal developmental processes to potentiate disease resistance mechanisms.},

"Salmonella persistently infects poultry because of its high mass of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), high-density growth, and motility as well as its ability to thrive in notably harsh conditions such as high acidity and oxidative stress found in the gastrointestinal tract [5]. As a Gram-negative bacterium, SE possesses an outer protective cell wall that harbors several pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) which stimulate inflammation in a host [5]. Salmonella infections are initiated through oral ingestion and can result in intestinal colonization and the dissemination of lipopolysaccharide to internal organs through circulation including the spleen [6]."

"The spleen harbors T and B lymphocytes and as the main secondary lymphoid organ, it is the center for cellular and adaptive immunity, [7] thus infections can disrupt its normal functioning [8]. Also, maturation and storage of monocytes, B cells (mediator of humoral adaptive immunity), T cells (mediator of cellular adaptive immunity), and phagocytosis occur in the spleen. Broiler chicken challenge studies aimed at understanding the pathogenesis of Salmonella infection showed that infection induces inflammation associated with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the gut lumen [9], as well as an influx of heterophils into the gut lumen."

“At phylum level, Actinobacteria was significantly enriched in W36 at all time points while Synergistetes (53 weeks), Spirochaetes (58 weeks), and Synergistetes and Spirochaetes (67 weeks) were significantly higher in HB” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 1)
\par
“The effect of housing and strains was not only seen at the bacterial composition and structure but also reflected at their functional level. Notably, KEGG metabolic pathways predicted to be involved in carbohydrates degradation and amino acids biosynthesis by PICRUSt analysis were significantly different between W36 and HB housed at CC and EC. In sum, cecal microbiota composition, diversities, and their functional pathways were affected by housing type which further varied between two commercial laying hen strains, HB and W36. This suggests that both housing and genetic strains of laying hens should be considered for selection of the alternative housing systems such as enriched colony cage.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 1)

“Although previous studies have investigated the performance parameters and welfare of laying hens housed in CC and EC cages, there is very limited information regarding the changes in gut microbiota, particularly in ceca. Our research findings will be important to the primary breeders to help in the decision-making process to select certain types of breed for the specific housing environmen” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2)

“Traditionally, people focused mainly on the strategies to maximize the profit and productivity of poultry, and conventional cage (CC) system is one of those strategies developed during the 1930s and has been used in the traditional egg production since 1950s (3)” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2)

“The negative impacts of CC are mainly due to the limited space for movement that can cause musculoskeletal weakness, and low complexities of the environment, which can abolish many of their natural behaviors such as nesting, roosting, dust bathing, perching, and foraging (6–8).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2)
\par
“As an alternative, enriched colony cages (CC) were developed that provide more space for movement and comfort behaviors, and may allow for some dust bathing, nesting, foraging, and perching (11)” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2)

“2018.8 (17) utilizing the pipelines developed for paired-end data types. In sum, “demux emp-paired” method of q2-demux plugin was used to demultiplex sequencing reads followed by quality filtering and denoising with “dada2 denoise-paired” method of q2-dada2 (18) plugin available at QIIME 2. The truncation length of forward and reverse reads was set at 240 and 200 bp, respectively, which is based on the quality score criteria (≥30). Taxonomic assignments was performed using a Naive Bayes classifier (19) pre-trained with Greengenes (Version 13.8) 99\% OTUs (20) and q2-feature-classifier plugin, where the sequences have been trimmed to include only the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene bound by the 515F/806R primer pair. The coremetrics-phylogenetic method at a sampling depth of 31,060 was used to analyze Alpha and Beta diversity. Shannon’s diversity index (21) and UnWeighted UniFrac distance metric (22) were used to calculate alpha and beta diversity, respectively. All figures including Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) plot were created from ggplot2 package of R (23).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 4)

“Statistical differences among treatment groups at different taxonomic assignments were calculated using LEfSe (24) using criteria, P {$<$} 0.05, LDA score {$>$} 2.0. While comparing taxa between two hen strains, hen strains were used as Class and Housing types were used as subclass. Likewise, Housing types were used as Class and hen strains as subclass while comparing taxa between housing types. The significant differences in alpha diversity were calculated using the alpha-group-significance command of QIIME2 which uses Kruskal-Wallis test. On the contrary, statistical differences in beta diversity among groups were calculated by PERMANOVA test (25) using the beta-groupsignificance command of QIIME2 with pairwise comparison option. For both diversity analyses, the corrected P-values for multiple comparisons (q) were used to report a significant difference between two groups, where the level of significance was set at q {$<$} 0.05.

“Specifically, bifidobacteria are well-known for their ability to ferment complex carbohydrates in the lower part of the intestine that bypasses the degradation in the upper parts through various carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (43). They can ferment diverse complex carbon sources including gastric mucin, (trans)-galactooligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, malto-oligosaccharides, fructo-oligosaccharides, pectin, soybean oligosaccharides, and other plant derived-oligosaccharides. However, their ability to degrade particular carbon source is species/strain-dependent (44). Through fermentation, bifidobacteria can degrade complex carbohydrates to monosaccharides which are further degraded to intermediates of the hexose fermentation pathway (also known as Bifidobacterium shunt or fructose-6-phosphate shunt) (45) and finally converted to short-chain fatty acids, especially acetate and lactate (42).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 14) Make a note of this "

  abstract = {The primary goal of this research was to elucidate the novel influence of Brachiaria decumbens supplementation on broiler chicken growth performance, nutritional digestibility, cecal microbiota, intestinal histomorphology, carcass characteristics, and meat quality. A total of 300 male day-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were randomly subjected to six different treatment groups having five replicates per treatment with 10 birds in each replicate. In treatment 1, broiler chickens were fed commercial diets with no added additives; in treatment 2, broiler chickens were offered commercial diets containing 100~mg/kg of the antibiotic oxytetracycline. However, in treatments 3, 4, 5, and 6, broiler chickens received similar commercial diets supplemented with 25~mg/kg, 50~mg/kg, 75~mg/kg, and 100~mg/kg of B. decumbens ground leaf powder, respectively, without antibiotics. Throughout the 42-day trial, the body weight gain and total feed intake for each replicate were recorded every week to determine the growth performance. Then, on 21th and 42nd day, ten broilers from each treatment (two in each replicate) were randomly selected and slaughtered to assess the digestibility of nutrients, histomorphology of the small intestine, the population of the cecal microbiota, carcass characteristics, as well as quality of both breast and drumstick muscle. There were differences (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) in the growth performance, apparent ileal nutrient digestibility, intestinal histomorphology, carcass characteristics, and meat quality. Animals supplemented with 25~mg/kg of B. decumbens had higher growth performance and better ileal nutrient digestibility of protein, fiber, and ether extract, as well as higher villi height and carcass percentage with superior meat quality. Besides, the growth of E. faecalis during the starter phase was inhibited. In summary, B. decumbens supplementation at 25~mg/kg may be suggested as an optimal dose of as a prophylactic as well as an alternative for antibiotic growth promoter in stimulating the productivity of commercial broilers. This unconventional phytobiotic supplementation could be the key to replacing unnecessary antibiotics used in poultry feed.},

  abstract = {In this descriptive study, we used metagenomics to analyze the relationship between the morphological aspects of chicken feces and its respective bacterial compositions. The microbiota composition was determined by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA genes collected from fresh broiler feces at 19 d old. In total, 48 samples were collected and divided into 8 groups of 6 samples each. The morphological changes studied were feed passage (FP) and reddish mucus (RM). Each was classified into 3 levels of intensity: 1 (slight), 2 (moderate), or 3 (intense). Thus, the 8 groups studied were feed passage (FP-1; FP-2; FP-3), reddish mucus (RM-1; RM-2; RM-3), normal ileal feces (NIF), and cecal discharge (CD). The alpha diversity (Shannon's index) revealed that the CD group showed greater diversity, and was significantly different from FP-2, FP-3, and RM-1. The beta diversity showed that the CD group samples were more homogeneous than the ileal feces groups. The relative abundance analysis revealed that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla in the ileal feces groups. In CD, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant. The relative abundance at the genus level revealed 136 different bacterial genera. In the ileal feces groups, the two most abundant genera were Lactobacillus and Escherichia/Shigella, except in the FP-1 and RM-2 groups, which had the opposite order. Unlike the others, the CD group had a higher abundance of Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium. When comparing the NIF group with the others, significant changes were found in the fecal microbiota, with nine genera for the FP groups, 19 for the RM groups, and 61 when compared to CD. The results of the present study suggest that evaluation of fecal morphology is a fundamental task that makes it possible to act quickly and assertively, as the morphological aspects of the feces may be related to the composition and structure of fecal microbiota.},

Standard methods for determining changes in microbial taxa measure relative, rather than absolute abundances. Moreover, studies often analyze only stool, despite microbial diversity differing substantially among gastrointestinal (GI) locations. Here, we develop a quantitative framework to measure absolute abundances of individual bacterial taxa by combining the precision of digital PCR with the high-throughput nature of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. In a murine ketogenic-diet study, we compare microbial loads in lumenal and mucosal samples along the GI tract. Quantitative measurements of absolute (but not relative) abundances reveal decreases in total microbial loads on the ketogenic diet and enable us to determine the differential effects of diet on each taxon in stool and small-intestine mucosa samples. This rigorous quantitative microbial analysis framework, appropriate for diverse GI locations enables mapping microbial biogeography of the mammalian GI tract and more accurate analyses of changes in microbial taxa in microbiome studies.},

  abstract = {The recent increase in publicly available metagenomic datasets with geospatial metadata has made it possible to determine location-specific, microbial fingerprints from around the world. Such fingerprints can be useful for comparing microbial niches for environmental research, as well as for applications within forensic science and public health. To determine the regional specificity for environmental metagenomes, we examined 4305 shotgun-sequenced samples from the MetaSUB Consortium dataset—the most extensive public collection of urban microbiomes, spanning 60 different cities, 30 countries, and 6 continents. We were able to identify city-specific microbial fingerprints using supervised machine learning (SML) on the taxonomic classifications, and we also compared the performance of ten SML classifiers. We then further evaluated the five algorithms with the highest accuracy, with the city and continental accuracy ranging from 85–89\% to 90–94\%, respectively. Thereafter, we used these results to develop Cassandra, a random-forest-based classifier that identifies bioindicator species to aid in fingerprinting and can infer higher-order microbial interactions at each site. We further tested the Cassandra algorithm on the Tara Oceans dataset, the largest collection of marine-based microbial genomes, where it classified the oceanic sample locations with 83\% accuracy. These results and code show the utility of SML methods and Cassandra to identify bioindicator species across both oceanic and urban environments, which can help guide ongoing efforts in biotracing, environmental monitoring, and microbial forensics (MF).},

“Outside of humanassociated ecosystems, microbial forensics (MF) could feasibly be used—in the oceans, for example—for tracking deleterious algal blooms or organisms with unknown migration patterns [14]. This would be complementary to existing approaches in which oceanographers use discarded host DNA to ascertain the presence of a given species [15].” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 2)
\par
“The goal of microbial forensics is to be able to identify the point of origin, provenance, or likely history of any given sample using microbial fingerprints: distinct microbiomes that can identify their place of origin [16].” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 2)
\par
“Additionally, Segata et al., 2011, developed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) method and used LDA-based methods for finding biomarkers, including phenotypic indicators from 16S samples [21].” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 2)
\par
“Ideally, metagenomic datasets could be used to develop discriminating microbial signatures or fingerprints, but there is a lack of universally accepted tools for identifying bioindicator species from metagenomics data [10,23].” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 2)
\par
“Here, we present Cassandra, an SML tool to address these unmet needs of metagenomicsbased microbial forensics, which can predict bioindicator species from shotgun sequence datasets.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 3)
\par
“We chose to use a Random Forest because it yields output that is simple to interpret, stable against Gaussian noise, does not overfit in unbalanced datasets, and the standard deviation between the various preprocessor methods is extremely low.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 5)
\par
“Cassandra first does an 80–20 train-test split, creates a new tree based on the training set, and trains the model. It evaluates the accuracy of the test set. If the desired accuracy is achieved, Cassandra selects the run and reports the attributed features (microbes) for the run. The algorithm keeps running till we have 1000 instances to achieve consensus (which can be modified by users) with the desired accuracy. The weight of all the species is reported for each of those instances, which helps us understand higher-level interaction between species and the geolocation. Furthermore, another output file is generated which selects the top n-species of interest (which can be user modifiers) of interest which are bioindicator species.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 5)
\par
“We next examined the output of Cassandra after this processing, which details the weight associated with each microbe for classification with minimum accuracy. We found that microbial abundance (the amount of a given microbe) and microbial prevalence (the number of samples where the microbes were found) had a linear relationship (Figure 3A).” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 9)
\par
“Out of the 31 core microbial taxa in the MetaSUB dataset, we observed 4 of them in the top 50 bioindicator species, namely: Streptococcus mitis, Brevundimonas sp. GW460, Brevundimonas naejangsanensis, Cutibacterium acnes.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 9)
\par
“Using the MetaSUB dataset, we next examined the ability to predict other forensic features, including surface material (e.g., metal, glass, plastic), temperature, climate, and other clues of sample provenance. To develop these methods, we trained the MetaSUB species data on eight unique features, including surface type, sampling type, coastal city, climate, and others (Table 3). Each feature was analyzed independently using 3 crossvalidation methods (k-fold, leave one group out for the city, and one for the continent), which repeatedly uses part of the samples for learning the model, and the remainder for validating the predictions (Methods 2.3).” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 9)
\par
“In general, microbial data can also classify other associated features with geolocation, like elevation, coastal association, and climate. To confirm this, we also tested classification with LOGO, where we also saw some features like surface material (coarse) outperforming k-fold validation.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 9)
\par
“In general, we found that we were able to predict all taxon levels, with a precision and recall of greater than 65\% (Figure 4), including Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). For class, genus, and OTU, the accuracy was greater than 80\%. We then used OTUs to train Cassandra, which achieved 86.5\% accuracy (the top 15 bioindicators’ OTUs are depicted in Figure 4B).” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 9)
\par
“This investigation demonstrates that, even from varied mixtures of microbial communities, we can uniquely predict the provenance of a given metagenomic sample by its microbial fingerprint.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 12)
\par
“Deploying the MetaSUB protocol [4], we were able to classify the continent and city of origin from a given WGS metagenomic sample from the global dataset, with 94\% and 89\% accuracy, respectively, and the sea or ocean of origin with 83\% accuracy when using OTUs from the Tara Oceans dataset.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 12)
\par
“Species classified by Cassandra can be further used to monitor pathogenic outbreaks as well as the spread of” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 12)
\par
“AMR using additional resources. Databases like Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) [49], TerrestrialMetagenomeDB [50], and Microbe Directory (MD2) [51] can be used as ancillary information for defining phenotypes, and other attributes of the bioindicators species [52].” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 13)
\par
“Further applications include tracking the microbiome before and after exposure to diseases like SARS COV2 [57], and determining changes in the microibial composition following dietary alterations [58–60].” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 13)
\par
“However, such use requires caution, as it could contribute to errors, socioeconomic discrimination, or stigmatization, and the results would need to be verified, as with all other methods in forensics. Nonetheless, the tools, data, and methods are finally emerging to make such methods of tracking and provenance a reality.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 13)},

  abstract = {This research aimed to assess the impact of probiotic supplementation in the broiler diet on growth performance, nutrient utilization, noxious gas emissions, excreta micromiota and meat quality. One thousand six hundred and twenty male Ross 380 broilers (one-day-old, body weight, 42 ± 0.5 g and 5-week trial) were arbitrarily chosen and assigned to three nutritive treatments (basal diet and basal diet included with 0.1\%, and 0.2\% probiotic mixture [Bacillus subtilis 7.0 × 107 cfu/g, Bacillus licheniformis 4.1 × 107 cfu/g]) with 30 duplicates (18 birds each). Probiotic inclusion linearly increased (p {$<$} 0.05) broiler body weight gain (BWG) during Phases 1, 2 and the overall period and decreased (p {$<$} 0.05) feed conversion ratio (FCR) linearly on Phase 2 and the overall period. However, feed intake (FI) and mortality rate remained unaffected (p {$>$} 0.05). Though nutrient digestibility of nitrogen (N) tendency to increase (p {$<$} 0.05), dry matter (DM) and energy (E) did not influence (p {$>$} 0.05). Inclusion of a probiotic supplement linearly increased (p {$<$} 0.05) Lactobacillus and reduced Salmonella (p {$<$} 0.05) counts in broilers. Moreover, broilers fed a diet supplement with probiotic addition linearly decreased (p {$<$} 0.05) NH3, H2S, C2O and acetic acid emissions. The graded level of probiotic addition linearly reduced (p {$<$} 0.05) cooking loss and the tendency to decrease (p {$<$} 0.05) weight of bursa of Fabricius, but had no effect (p {$>$} 0.05) on other meat quality measures. These findings indicated that increasing the level of probiotics in feed could improve growth efficiency, nutrient absorption, microbial index, meat quality and reduce gas emissions in broilers.},

In the first study, three treatments were used: Unchallenged Control (UC); Challenged Control (CC; dietary challenge and 10× dose of coccidia vaccine); and a challenged group supplemented with PB (1.3 kg/ton). In the second study, three treatments were used: control diet, diet supplemented with Avilamycin (10 ppm), and a diet supplemented with PB (0.9 kg/ton). All the birds were exposed to natural challenge composed by dietary formulation and reused litter from a coccidiosis positive flock. In Trial 1, PB decreased ileal histological damage, increased villi length, and the expression of SLC5A8 in ileal tissue versus CC; it reduced ileal expression of IL-1β compared to both UC and CC treatments. PB increased the expression of cell cycling gene markers CCNA2 and CDK2 in the ileum compared to CC. In Trial 2, PB improved the growth performance, intestinal lesion scores and intestinal morphology of broiler chickens. These results indicate that birds supplemented with PB are more resilient to enteric challenges, probably by its action in modulating microbiome metabolic pathways related to nitrogen metabolism and protein utilization.},

"The first is the existence of core microbiome pathways for energy, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism across microorganisms [6]. The second is the recognition that these core microbiome pathways are highly conserved, even across diverse populations of individuals." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7FFP34YL?page=2}{Blokker et al 2022:2503})
\par
"The latter property lies in stark contrast to taxonomic composition (e.g., the gut microbial profile), which often varies significantly across a population of otherwise similar individuals [7]. These insights suggest that targeting core microbiome pathways, rather than working to adjust the microbial profile, offers the potential for improved consistency [4]."

"One strategy for developing PB is by screening tailored glycans for their ability to modulate selected microbiome pathways across a diverse set of microbial communities [8,9]. Glycans provide a chemically diverse class of molecular structures known to exhibit a wide array of bioactivities on microbial communities [10,11]."

\par
"This close symbiotic relationship has given way to the idea of the holo-biont, as an organism composed of the host and its microbiome [14]. However, when this symbiotic relationship is disturbed by enteric infections, such as coccidiosis in broiler chickens, the use of PB to redirect microbial metabolic functions may be an important nutritional strategy to minimize the negative impact of such infections."

  abstract = {Broiler leg diseases are a common abnormal bone metabolism issue that leads to poor leg health in growing poultry. Bone metabolism is a complicated regulatory process controlled by genetic, nutritional, feeding management, environmental, or other influencing factors. The gut microbiota constitutes the largest micro-ecosystem in animals and is closely related to many metabolic disorders, including bone disease, by affecting the absorption of nutrients and the barrier function of the gastrointestinal tract and regulating the immune system and even the brain–gut–bone axis. Recently, probiotic-based dietary supplementation has emerged as an emerging strategy to improve bone health in chickens by regulating bone metabolism based on the gut–bone axis. This review aims to summarize the regulatory mechanisms of probiotics in the gut microbiota on bone metabolism and to provide new insights for the prevention and treatment of bone diseases in broiler chickens.},

  abstract = {The objectives of this review paper are to introduce the structures and composition of various microorganisms, to show some applications of single cells as alternative protein supplements or energy feeds in swine and poultry diets, and to discuss the functional effects of microorganisms as feed additives on the growth performance and intestinal health of nursery pigs and broilers. Microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and microalgae, have been commonly supplemented in animal diets because they are cost-effective, stable, and have quantitative production that provides nutritional and functional benefits to pigs and broilers. Microorganisms could be alternative antibiotics to enhance intestinal health due to bioactive components from cell wall components, which interact with receptors on epithelial and immune cells. In addition, bioactive components could be digested by intestinal microbiota to produce short-chain fatty acids and enhance energy utilization. Otherwise, microorganisms such as single-cell protein (SCP) and single-cell oils (SCOs) are sustainable and economic choices to replace conventional protein supplements and energy feeds. Supplementing microorganisms as feedstuffs and feed additives improved the average daily gain by 1.83\%, the daily feed intake by 0.24\%, and the feed efficiency by 1.46\% in pigs and broilers. Based on the properties of each microorganism, traditional protein supplements, energy feeds, and functional feed additives could be replaced by microorganisms, which have shown benefits to animal’s growth and health. Therefore, specific microorganisms could be promising alternatives as nutritional and functional feedstuffs in animal diets.},

  abstract = {Uncultivated Bacteria and Archaea account for the vast majority of species on Earth, but obtaining their genomes directly from the environment, using shotgun sequencing, has only become possible recently. To realize the hope of capturing Earth’s microbial genetic complement and to facilitate the investigation of the functional roles of specific lineages in a given ecosystem, technologies that accelerate the recovery of high-quality genomes are necessary. We present a series of analysis steps and data products for the extraction of high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from microbiomes using the U.S. Department of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase) platform (http://www.kbase.us/). Overall, these steps take about a day to obtain extracted genomes when starting from smaller environmental shotgun read libraries, or up to about a week from larger libraries. In KBase, the process is end-to-end, allowing a user to go from the initial sequencing reads all the way through to MAGs, which can then be analyzed with other KBase capabilities such as phylogenetic placement, functional assignment, metabolic modeling, pangenome functional profiling, RNA-Seq and others. While portions of such capabilities are available individually from other resources, the combination of the intuitive usability, data interoperability and integration of tools in a freely available computational resource makes KBase a powerful platform for obtaining MAGs from microbiomes. While this workflow offers tools for each of the key steps in the genome extraction process, it also provides a scaffold that can be easily extended with additional MAG recovery and analysis tools, via the KBase software development kit (SDK).},

  abstract = {The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of Eimeria tenella infection on the cecal microbiome, the protein concentration of cecal content, cecal mucosal immunity, and serum endotoxin levels in broilers. Three hundred sixty 14-day-old broilers were allocated to five infection doses with six replicates. The five infection doses were: ID0: 0, ID1: 6250, ID2: 12,500, ID3: 25,000, and ID4: 50,000 Eimeria tenella oocysts. Eimeria tenella infection significantly increased the relative abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria, which includes diverse pathogenic bacteria, and significantly decreased the relative abundance of the phylum Firmicutes. Protein concentration of the cecal content was linearly increased (p {$<$} 0.05), and the concentration of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in the cecal content was linearly decreased by Eimeria tenella infection (p {$<$} 0.05). Goblet cell density was linearly reduced in the ceca by Eimeria tenella infection (p {$<$} 0.05). Eimeria tenella infection tended to linearly decrease the relative mRNA expression of antimicrobial peptide genes such as avian beta-defensin 9 (AvBD9; p = 0.10) and liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2; p = 0.08) in the cecal tissue. Therefore, Eimeria tenella infection negatively modulated cecal microbiota via impairing cecal mucosal immunity and increasing protein concentration in the cecal content in broilers.},

While short-read 16S rRNA analyses are largely confined to genus-level resolution at best, given that only a portion of the gene is sequenced, full-length 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences have the potential to provide species-level accuracy. However, existing taxonomic identification algorithms are not optimized for the increased read length and error rate often observed in long-read data. Here we present Emu, an approach that uses an expectation-maximization algorithm to generate taxonomic abundance profiles from full-length 16S rRNA reads. Results produced from simulated datasets and mock communities show that Emu is capable of accurate microbial community profiling while obtaining fewer false positives and false negatives than alternative methods. Additionally, we illustrate a real-world application of Emu by comparing clinical sample composition estimates generated by an established whole-genome shotgun sequencing workflow with those returned by full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences processed with Emu.},

  abstract = {The microbiome is an integral part of chicken health and can affect immunity, nutrient utilization, and performance. The role of bacterial microbiota members in host health is relatively well established, but less attention has been paid to fungal members of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) community. However, human studies indicate that fungi play a critical role in health. Here, we described fungal communities, or mycobiomes, in both the lumen and mucosa of the chicken ileum and cecum from hatch through 14 days of age. We also assessed the effects of delayed access to feed immediately post-hatch (PH) on mycobiome composition, as PH feed delay is commonly associated with poor health performance. Chicken mycobiomes in each of the populations were distinct and changed over time. All mycobiomes were dominated by Gibberella, but Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Sarocladium, Meyerozyma, and Penicillium were also abundant. Relative abundances of some taxa differed significantly over time. In the cecal and ileal lumens, Penicillium was present in extremely low quantities or absent during days one and two and then increased over time. Meyerozyma and Wickerhamomyces also increased over time in luminal sites. In contrast, several highly abundant unclassified fungi decreased after days one and two, highlighting the need for improved understanding of fungal gut biology. Mycobiomes from chicks fed during the first 2~days PH versus those not fed during the first 2~days did not significantly differ, except during days one and two. Similarities observed among mycobiomes of fed and unfed chicks at later timepoints suggest that delays in PH feeding do not have long lasting effects on mycobiome composition. Together, these results provide a foundation for future mycobiome studies, and suggest that negative health and production impacts of delayed feeding are not likely related to the development of fungal populations in the GIT.},

Since, fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) regulates the gut microbial diversity and affects the productive performance of the bird. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of FMT from feed-efficient broiler chicken could program the diversity of gut microbiota and growth of recipient native slow growing egg-laying chicks. For this, a total of 150 (one-day-old) Jing Hong chicks were randomly assigned into two groups, each group consisted of 5 replicates (n =\,15 bird/ replicate). The control group (CON) and FMT recipient birds (FMT) fed on basal diet, the FMT group received an oral daily dose of FMT prepared from Cobb-500 chickens. The FMT performed from the 1d to 28d of age, through the experimental period, feed intake and body weight were recorded weekly. At the end of a 28-day trial, carcass traits were assessed and cecal samples were collected for microbiome assessment via 16S rRNA-based metagenomic analysis to characterize the diversity and functions of microbial communities. The data were statistically analyzed using R software. Body weight and body weight gain increased, and FCR decreased (p =\,0.01) in FMT group. The relative abundance of Firmicutes and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio were increased due to FMT administration (p\,=\,0.01). A higher relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Bifidobacterium were presented in the FMT group. Meanwhile, Enterococcus, Helicobacter, and Bacteroides were more abundant in the CON group (p\,{$<$}\,0.01). Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways for microbial functions regarding amino acid metabolism, secondary metabolites biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and enzyme families, cofactors, and vitamins were significantly annotated in the FMT group. Overall, FMT administration from the donor of highly feed-efficient broilers improved weight gain by reshaping a distinct gut microbiome, which may be related to the metabolism and health in the recipients laying chicks, providing new insight on the application of the FMT technique for early life programming of laying chickens.},

  abstract = {In the poultry industry worldwide,               Clostridium perfringens               has been causing major economic loss as it can cause necrotic enteritis (NE). The coccidial infection has been considered as the most important predisposing factor of NE caused by               C. perfringens               . In this study, we aimed to advance our knowledge on ileal microbiota of yellow feather broilers under               C. perfringens               and/or               Eimeria               challenge. Total of 80 healthy day old yellow feather broilers were randomly assigned to four groups including: Control,               C. perfringens               challenge group (C. Per),               Eimeria               challenge group (Cocc), and               C. perfringens               plus               Eimeria               challenge group (Comb). On day 14, the Cocc and Comb group broilers were orally gavaged 1 ml PBS solution containing 25,000 oocysts of               Eimeria brunetti               and 25,000 oocysts of               Eimeria maxima               . Starting on day 17, the C. Per and Comb group broilers were orally gavaged 10 mL of               C. perfringens               per bird (4 × 10               7               CFU/mL, ATCC               ®               13124™ Strain) every day for 6 days. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on extracted DNA of ileal digesta samples. The results showed that               C. perfringens               alone did not affect the alpha diversity of ileal microbiome in yellow feather broilers but co-infection with               Eimeria               significantly decreased the diversity of ileal microbiota.               C. perfringens               and               Eimeria               challenge also decreased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria including               Bacteroidetes               at the phylum level and               Faecalibacterium               at the genus level.

Modulating the gut microbiota through the fibrous content present in these wastes may help mitigate the adverse effects of heat stress (HS). Here, we investigated the effects of dietary steam-exploded pine particle (SPP), a value-added waste product, on the performance, gut health, and cecum microbiota in heat-stressed broilers. Ross 308 broilers (n\,=\,180) at 29~days of age were distributed into three dietary treatment groups (0\%, 1\%, and 2\% SPP) and two temperature conditions (NT: 21~°C; CHS: 31~°C) and grown for seven days. CHS, but not SPP, adversely affected performance parameters, but SPP did not interactively modulate these results. On the contrary, both differently affected other parameters. CHS resulted in increased rectal temperature, total protein in serum, and Nox4 gene expression, whereas 2\% SPP increased GLP-2 and the Nox4 gene expression in the duodenum in comparison to 0\% and 1\% SPP. CHS significantly modified the beta-diversity of cecal microbiota while 1\% SPP supplementation in diets increased the abundance of the favorable bacterial genera in chicken. Concludingly, CHS adversely affects growth performances, gut health, stress-related genes, and cecal microbiota while dietary 1\% SPP may facilitate the proliferation of beneficial microorganisms in the cecum of broilers.},

  abstract = {Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in microbial genomes encode for bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs), which can play important roles in microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions. Given the biological significance of SMs and the current profound interest in the metabolic functions of microbiomes, the unbiased identification of BGCs from high-throughput metagenomic data could offer novel insights into the complex chemical ecology of microbial communities. Currently available tools for predicting BGCs from shotgun metagenomes have several limitations, including the need for computationally demanding read-assembly; predicting a narrow breadth of BGC classes; and not providing the SM product. To overcome these limitations, we developed TaxiBGC (Taxonomy-guided Identification of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters), a command-line tool for predicting experimentally characterized BGCs (and inferring their known SMs) in metagenomes by first pinpointing the microbial species likely to harbor them. We benchmarked TaxiBGC on various simulated metagenomes, showing that our taxonomy-guided approach could predict BGCs with much-improved performance (mean F1 score: 0.56, mean PPV score: 0.80) compared to directly identifying BGCs by mapping sequencing reads onto the BGC genes (mean F1 score: 0.49, mean PPV score: 0.41). Next, by applying TaxiBGC on 2,650 metagenomes from the Human Microbiome Project and various case-control gut microbiome studies, we were able to associate BGCs (and their SMs) with different human body sites and with multiple gastrointestinal diseases, including Crohn’s disease and liver cirrhosis. In all, TaxiBGC provides an in silico platform to predict experimentally characterized BGCs and their SM production potential in metagenomic data while demonstrating important advantages over existing techniques.},

  abstract = {Background Sub-therapeutic antibiotics are widely used as growth promoters in the poultry industry; however, the resulting antibiotic resistance threatens public health. A plant-derived growth promoter, Macleaya cordata extract (MCE), with effective ingredients of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, is a potential alternative to antibiotic growth promoters. Altered intestinal microbiota play important roles in growth promotion, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Results We generated 1.64 terabases of metagenomic data from 495 chicken intestinal digesta samples and constructed a comprehensive chicken gut microbial gene catalog (9.04 million genes), which is also the first gene catalog of an animal’s gut microbiome that covers all intestinal compartments. Then, we identified the distinctive characteristics and temporal changes in the foregut and hindgut microbiota. Next, we assessed the impact of MCE on chickens and gut microbiota. Chickens fed with MCE had improved growth performance, and major microbial changes were confined to the foregut, with the predominant role of Lactobacillus being enhanced, and the amino acids, vitamins, and secondary bile acids biosynthesis pathways being upregulated, but lacked the accumulation of antibiotic-resistance genes. In comparison, treatment with chlortetracycline similarly enriched some biosynthesis pathways of nutrients in the foregut microbiota, but elicited an increase in antibiotic-producing bacteria and antibiotic-resistance genes. Conclusion The reference gene catalog of the chicken gut microbiome is an important supplement to animal gut metagenomes. Metagenomic analysis provides insights into the growth-promoting mechanism of MCE, and underscored the importance of utilizing safe and effective growth promoters.

“Probiotics are living microorganisms that confer benefits to the host, examples being Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 2)
\par
“The phytobiotic Macleaya cordata extract (MCE) has been widely used, for decades, in feed livestock in many countries [9]. The effective chemical composition of MCE includes sanguinarine and chelerythrine, both belonging to a group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, which have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties [10–12].” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 2)
\par
“In this study, we constructed the first comprehensive chicken gut microbial gene catalog, to better understand the related microbiota” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 2)
\par
“We collected 495 digesta samples from the five intestinal compartments (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colorectum) of chickens raised in 7 different farms in China” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 2)
\par
“Based on the assembled contigs with an N50 contig length of 1.95 kb, we identified 9.04 million non-redundant genes, with an average open reading frame (ORF) length of 697 bp.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 2)
\par
“By comparing the pairwise overlap, at the gene sequence level, we determined that over 80\% of genes are unique to each species, and only a very small percentage (\textasciitilde{} 0.5\%) of genes are shared by chickens, humans, and pigs.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 2)
\par
“Using CAMRA3 for taxonomic assignment, 80.99\% of the genes in the chicken gut catalog were taxonomically classified at the superkingdom level, among which bacteria account for 98.95\% of the classified genes, with the remaining 1\% being from archaea and eukaryotes. More than 88\% of the bacterial genes are from the top four phyla, including Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 2)
\par
“t lower taxonomic levels, 25.97\% and 2.29\% of the genes in this catalog were annotated to genus and species, respectively.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 2)
\par
“Note that the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing genera, such as Bacteroides, Blautia, Ruminococcus, and Faecalibacterium, are among the major genera in both human” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 2)
\par
“Notably, the genes for glycan biosynthesis and metabolism were more abundant in human and pig guts, whereas” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 4)
\par
“whereas the genes for membrane transport, an essential mechanism for the uptake of substrates, such as sugars, lipids, peptides, and ions, were more abundant in the chicken gut microbiota (Fig. 1f ).” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 4)
\par
“The enriched genes for membrane transport likely reflect the availability of more nutrient substrates, in the chicken intestine, for direct microbial utilization. The more abundant genes for metabolism of xenobiotics, terpenoids, and polyketides, in the chicken gut, are relevant to the abundant bacterial phylum Actinobacteria, which decomposes organic matter and produces various natural drugs, enzymes, and bioactive metabolites” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 4)
\par
“Distinguished by the difference in morphology and function, the chicken intestinal tract can be divided into the foregut and hindgut.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 4)
\par
“The foregut contains the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum compartments. The duodenum has the major function in feed digestion by using digestive enzymes and bile from the pancreas and liver, and the released nutrients, such as amino acids, fatty acids, sugars, and peptides, are mainly absorbed in the jejunum and ileum.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 4)
\par
“The hindgut contains the cecum and colorectum. Substantial microbial fermentation occurs in the cecum, which provides nutrients, detoxifies some harmful substances, and also helps to prevent pathogen colonization [20,21].” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 4)
\par
“Previous chicken gut studies focused more on cecal or fecal microbiota [23–25], and some microbial functions such as polysaccharide utilization, SCFAs production, and hydrogen consumption in the cecum have been studied” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 4)
\par
“he microbiota in the foregut where nutrient absorption primarily occurs were mostly studied by 16S rRNA gene sequencing with limited sample size” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 4)
\par
“In this part of our study, metagenomic data of 285 samples from all five intestinal compartments in chickens older than 40 days were analyzed (Fig. 1a and Additional file 1: Table S1).” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 4)
\par
“Our results indicated that microbial diversities in the foregut compartments were approximately the same, with only a slight increase from duodenum, jejunum, to ileum” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 6)
\par
“A similar situation was observed between the hindgut cecum and colorectum; however, the diversities were clearly higher in the hindgut than in the foregut compartment (Fig. 2a)” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 6)
\par
“We next calculated the number of common genes presented in 50\% of the samples from each intestinal compartment, and the results showed that the common genes accounted for only about 2\% of all genes in each foregut compartment (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), but the number increased to 18\% and 13\% in the cecum and colorectum, respectively (Additional file 12: Table S4)” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 6)
\par
“Taken together, these results indicated an overall similarity within foregut and hindgut compartments, with a larger difference between them, which is consistent with previous studies” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 6)
\par
“Lactobacillus is the predominant genus in the foregut, but not in the hindgut (Additional file 4: Table S3); Lactobacillus provides nutrients to the host and defends against opportunistic pathogens” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 6)
\par
“n the foregut, Lactobacillus competitively inhibits a cluster of bacteria, with negative correlations with all these genera” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 6)
\par
“Additionally, some SCFA producers, such as Clostridium, Butyricicoccus,andFaecalibacterium, showed positive correlations with one another and form a relatively independent and stable cluster” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 6)
\par
“These results revealed more diverse and complex microbial communities in the hindgut than in the foregut.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 6)
\par
“the microbiota in the foregut was enriched in genetic information processing for transcription, translation, and replication, as well as the metabolic functions of nucleotides and lipids, whereas microbes in the hindgut were enriched for the metabolic functions of amino acids, energy metabolism, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 6)
\par
“Lactobacillus has a relatively small genome (2 Mb) compared to other bacteria, and encodes higher proportion of genes for basic functions such as transcription, translation, and replication, but lower proportion of genes for many diverse metabolic functions. Therefore, the predominance of Lactobacillus in the foregut has largely contributed to the functional differences between the foregut and hindgut microbiome.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 6)
\par
“Our data showed that the gut microbiome of newly hatched chicks (day 1) were highly variable and obviously different from other samples (day 7, 14, 28, and 42) (Fig. 3), reflecting the shortterm exposure to the environment and the initiation of gut microbial communities.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 8)
\par
“The findings showed that the early days are critical both for chicken development and establishment of the gut microbiota.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 8)
\par
“In the MCE groups, a greater variety of pathways were enriched, including lipoic acid, vitamin B6, riboflavin, ubiquinone, and other terpenoid-quinone (including vitamin K1,K2, and E) pathways (Fig. 4d). In summary, vitamins, in addition to other microbial synthesized nutrients, were enhanced by MCE and consequently benefited the host.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 11)

“and zebrafish genomes by BWA-MEM were filtered out” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 13)
\par
“Finally, short reads (length {$<$} 75-bp) and unpaired reads were also excluded to form a clean reads data.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 13)
\par
“For each sample, the clean reads were assembled by Megahit (v1.0.6) under pair-end mode respectively [73], then gene prediction was performed on contigs larger than 500-bp by Prodigal (v2.6.3) with parameter “-p meta” [74], and gene models with cds length less than 102-bp were filtered out.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 13)
\par
“due to the memory limitation of our computer server, all the 495 samples were firstly divided into 5 study groups: distribution groups (135 samples), treatment groups for LY chickens with 56 days (75 samples), treatment groups for LY chickens with 1–42 days (105 samples), treatment groups for AA chickens with 42 days (75 samples), and treatment groups for AA chickens with 1–42 days (105 samples). Then, assembly and gene prediction were performed on these five study groups independently, using the same methods for each sample.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 13)
\par
“A non-redundant gene catalog was constructed using the gene models predicted from each sample and each group by cd-hit-est (v4.6.6) [75] with parameter “-c 0.95 -n 10 -G 0 -aS 0.9,” which adopts a greedy incremental clustering algorithm and the criteria of identity {$>$} 95\% and overlap {$>$} 90\% of the shorter genes. By using the gene models predicted from each sample only, we obtained 6 M non-redundant genes; by adding the additional gene models predicted from each group, finally, we obtained a total of 9 M non-redundant genes.” (Huang et al., 2018, p. 13)

  abstract = {This study focuses on the role of the ceca in nitrogen nutrition in chickens (Gallus domesticus). Urea is a very good nitrogen tracer for these studies. Little urea is synthesized by chickens due to the absence of carbamyl phosphate synthetase, an essential enzyme initiating the urea cycle. Urea is utilized by chickens when crystalline amino acid diets low in nonessential nitrogen or diets containing low concentrations of intact protein are fed, and most ureolytic activity is found in the ceca. Dietary urea was absorbed intact from the upper intestine of the chicken. The absorbed urea was excreted into ureteral urine that refluxed from the cloaca into the colon and ceca where urea was degraded to ammonia. Presumably the ammonia was incorporated into amino acids by cecal microorganisms and some urea, amino acids and proteins were absorbed from the ceca. These were utilized by the chickens. A beneficial role of ceca in the nitrogen metabolism in the chicken is, therefore, conservation of urinary nitrogen in protein-depleted chickens. J. Exp.

  abstract = {Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe gastrointestinal disease in premature infants and a leading cause of death in neonates (1–7\% in the US). NEC is caused by opportunistic bacteria, which cause gut dysbiosis and inflammation and ultimately result in intestinal necrosis. Previous studies have utilized the rodent and pig models to mimic NEC, whereas the current study uses the in vivo (Gallus gallus) intra-amniotic administration approach to investigate NEC. On incubation day 17, broiler chicken (Gallus gallus) viable embryos were injected intra-amniotically with 1 mL dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in H2O. Four treatment groups (0.1\%, 0.25\%, 0.5\%, and 0.75\% DSS) and two controls (H2O/non-injected controls) were administered. We observed a significant increase in intestinal permeability and negative intestinal morphological changes, specifically, decreased villus surface area and goblet cell diameter in the 0.50\% and 0.75\% DSS groups. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in pathogenic bacterial (E. coli spp. and Klebsiella spp.) abundances in the 0.75\% DSS group compared to the control groups, demonstrating cecal microbiota dysbiosis. These results demonstrate significant physiopathology of NEC and negative bacterial–host interactions within a premature gastrointestinal system. Our present study demonstrates a novel model of NEC through intra-amniotic administration to study the effects of NEC on intestinal functionality, morphology, and gut microbiota in vivo.},

This study was aimed to investigate the associations of gut microbiome with cognitive impairment and brain structure based on multi-omics from three independent populations.                                         Methods                                We included 1430 participants from the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study (GNHS) with both gut microbiome and cognitive assessment data available as a discovery cohort, of whom 272 individuals provided fecal samples twice before cognitive assessment. We selected 208 individuals with baseline microbiome data for brain magnetic resonance imaging during the follow-up visit. Fecal 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, targeted serum metabolomics, and cytokine measurements were performed in the GNHS. The validation analyses were conducted in an Alzheimer’s disease case–control study (replication study 1,                 n                 \,=\,90) and another community-based cohort (replication study 2,                 n                 \,=\,1300) with cross-sectional dataset.

Result of                 Bacteroides                 was further validated in the replication study 2.                 Odoribacter                 was positively associated with hippocampal volume (β, 0.16; 95\% CI 0.06–0.26,                 P                 \,=\,0.002), which might be mediated by acetic acids. Increased intra-individual alterations in gut microbial composition were found in participants with cognitive impairment. We also identified several serum metabolites and inflammation-associated metagenomic species and pathways linked to impaired cognition.                                                        Conclusions               Our findings reveal that specific gut microbial features are closely associated with cognitive impairment and decreased hippocampal volume, which may play an important role in dementia development.},

  abstract = {The current study was performed to explore the effects of dietary supplementation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae hydrolysate (SCH) on growth performance, immune function, and intestinal health in broiler chicken. A total of 300 Ross 308 male broilers (1-day-old) were randomly assigned to 2 dietary treatments including a basal diet (control group), and a basal diet supplemented with SCH feed additive (500 mg/kg in starter and grower phase, and 250 mg/kg in finisher phase). Each treatment had 6 replicates with 25 birds each. The results showed that the addition of SCH promoted growth during d 15 to 28 (P {$<$} 0.05). Although the addition of SCH had no significant effect on the intestinal relative indexes, it significantly increased the jejunum villus height (VH) and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (VCR) of jejunum, and decreased the crypt depth (CD) of ileum (P {$<$} 0.05). Furthermore, SCH addition significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of immunomodulatory genes (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), and upregulated the tight junction genes (ZO-1 and Claudin-1) (P {$<$} 0.05). High throughput sequencing analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA revealed that dietary SCH supplementation altered cecum microbiota. Alpha diversity analysis showed that a higher bacterial richness in cecum of broilers fed with SCH. The composition of cecum microbiota regulated by SCH addition was characterized by an increased abundance of Firmicutes and a reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes. At the genus level, dietary SCH resulted in a decrease of Bacteroides and an increase of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) -producing bacteria including Lactobacillus and Faecalibacterium. Taken together, dietary SCH supplementation can stimulate the growth of broilers by regulating the intestinal immunity and barrier function, and improving the intestinal morphology, which may be related to the enhancement of bacterial diversity and the changes of intestinal microbial composition.},

  abstract = {It is known that data from both 16S and shotgun metagenomics studies are subject to biases that cause the observed relative abundances of taxa to differ from their true values. Model community analyses, in which the relative abundances of all taxa in the sample are known by construction, seem to offer the hope that these biases can be measured. However, it is unclear whether the bias we measure in a mock community analysis is the same as we measure in a sample in which taxa are spiked in at known relative abundance, or if the biases we measure in spike-in samples is the same as the bias we would measure in a real (e.g., biological) sample. Here, we consider these questions in the context of 16S rRNA measurements on three sets of samples: the commercially available Zymo cells model community; the Zymo model community mixed with Swedish Snus, a smokeless tobacco product that is virtually bacteria-free; and a set of commercially available smokeless tobacco products. Each set of samples was subject to four different extraction protocols. The goal of our analysis is to determine whether the patterns of bias observed in each set of samples are the same, i.e., can we learn about the bias in the commercially available smokeless tobacco products by studying the Zymo cells model community?},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages selectively infect and kill their target bacterial host, being a promising approach to controlling zoonotic bacteria in poultry production. To ensure confidence in its use, fundamental questions of safety and toxicity monitoring of phage therapy should be raised. Due to its high specificity, a minimal impact on the gut ecology is expected; however, more in-depth research into key parameters that influence the success of phage interventions has been needed to reach a consensus on the impact of bacteriophage therapy in the gut. In this context, this study aimed to investigate the interaction of phages with animals; more specifically, we compared the caecum microbiome and metabolome after a               Salmonella               phage challenge in               Salmonella               -free broilers, evaluating the role of the phage administration route. To this end, we employed 45 caecum content samples from a previous study where               Salmonella               phages were administered               via               drinking water or feed for 24~h from 4, 5 to 6-weeks-old broilers. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed a high level of similarity (beta diversity) but revealed a significant change in alpha diversity between broilers with               Salmonella               -phage administered in the drinking water and control. Our results showed that the phages affected only a few genera of the microbiota’s structure, regardless of the administration route. Among these, we found a significant increase in               Streptococcus               and               Sellimonas               in the drinking water and               Lactobacillus               ,               Anaeroplasma               and               Clostridia\_vadinBB60\_group               in the feed. Nevertheless, the LC-HRMS-based metabolomics analyses revealed that despite few genera were significantly affected, a substantial number of metabolites, especially in the phage administered in the drinking water were significantly altered (64 and 14 in the drinking water and feed groups, respectively). Overall, our study shows that preventive therapy with bacteriophages minimally alters the caecal microbiota but significantly impacts their metabolites, regardless of the route of administration.},

  abstract = {Diversity measurement is important for understanding community structure and dynamics, but has been particularly challenging for microbes. Microbial community characterization using small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequences has revealed an extensive, previously unsuspected diversity that we are only now beginning to understand, especially now that advanced sequencing technologies are producing data sets containing hundreds of thousands of sequences from hundreds of samples. Efforts to quantify microbial diversity often use taxon-based methods that ignore the fact that not all species are equally related, which can therefore obscure important patterns in the data. For example, α diversity (diversity within communities) is often estimated as the number of species in a community (species richness), and β diversity (partitioning of diversity among communities) is often based on the number of shared species. Methods for measuring α diversity and β diversity that account for different levels of divergence between individuals have recently been more widely applied. These methods are more powerful than taxon-based methods because microbes in a community differ dramatically in sequence similarity, which also often correlates with phenotypic similarity in key features such as metabolic capabilities. Consequently, divergence-based methods are providing new insights into microbial community structure and function.},

  abstract = {Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a gastro-intestinal (GI) infection that illustrates how perturbations in symbiotic host–microbiome interactions render the GI tract vulnerable to the opportunistic pathogens. CDI also serves as an example of how such perturbations could be reversed via gut microbiota modulation mechanisms, especially fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). However, microbiome-mediated diagnosis of CDI remains understudied. Here, we evaluated the diagnostic capabilities of the fecal microbiome on the prediction of CDI. We used the metagenomic sequencing data from ten previous studies, encompassing those acquired from CDI patients treated by FMT, CDI-negative patients presenting other intestinal health conditions, and healthy volunteers taking antibiotics. We designed a hybrid species/function profiling approach that determines the abundances of microbial species in the community contributing to its functional profile. These functionally informed taxonomic profiles were then used for classification of the microbial samples. We used logistic regression (LR) models using these features, which showed high prediction accuracy (with an average AUC≥0.91), substantiating that the species/function composition of the gut microbiome has a robust diagnostic prediction of CDI. We further assessed the confounding impact of antibiotic therapy on CDI prediction and found that it is distinguishable from the CDI impact. Finally, we devised a log-odds score computed from the output of the LR models to quantify the likelihood of CDI in a gut microbiome sample and applied it to evaluating the effectiveness of FMT based on post-FMT microbiome samples. The results showed that the gut microbiome of patients exhibited a gradual but steady improvement after receiving successful FMT, indicating the restoration of the normal microbiome functions.},

  abstract = {Currently, feed enzymes are primarily obtained through fermentation of fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms. Although the manufacturing technology for feed enzymes has evolved rapidly, the activities of these enzymes decline during the granulating process and the cost of application has increased over time. An alternative approach is the use of genetically modified plants containing complex feed enzymes for direct utilization in animal feedstuff. We co-expressed three commonly used feed enzymes (phytase, β-glucanase, and xylanase) in barley seeds using the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method and generated a new barley germplasm. The results showed that these enzymes were stable and had no effect on the development of the seeds. Supplementation of the basal diet of laying hens with only 8\% of enzyme-containing seeds decreased the quantities of indigestible carbohydrates, improved the availability of phosphorus, and reduced the impact of animal production on the environment to an extent similar to directly adding exogenous enzymes to the feed. Feeding enzyme-containing seeds to layers significantly increased the strength of the eggshell and the weight of the eggs by 10.0\%–11.3\% and 5.6\%–7.7\%, respectively. The intestinal microbiota obtained from layers fed with enzyme-containing seeds was altered compared to controls and was dominated by Alispes and Rikenella. Therefore, the transgenic barley seeds produced in this study can be used as an ideal feedstuff for use in animal feed.},

In this paper, the indigenous intestinal bacteria and the microbial fermentation profile particularly short chain fatty acids (SCFA), lactate, and ammonia concentrations are reviewed. The intestinal bacterial composition changes with age. The bacterial density of the small intestine increases with age and comprises of lactobacilli, streptococci, enterobacteria, fusobacteria and eubacteria. Strict anaerobes (anaerobic gram-positive cocci, Eubacterium spp., Clostridium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Bacteroides) are predominating caecal bacteria in young broilers. Data from culture-based studies showed that bifidobacteria could not be isolated from young birds, but were recovered from four-week-old broilers. Caecal lactobacilli accounted for 1.5 – 24\% of the caecal bacteria. Gene sequencing of caecal DNA extracts showed that the majority of bacteria belonged to Clostridiaceae. Intestinal bacterial community is influenced by the dietary ingredients, nutrient levels and physical structure of feed. SCFA and other metabolic products are affected by diet formulation and age. Additional studies are required to know the bacterial metabolic activities together with the community analysis of the intestinal bacteria. Feed composition and processing have great potential to influence the activities of intestinal bacteria towards a desired direction in order to support animal health, well-being and microbial safety of broiler meat.},

  abstract = {Heat stress is one of the most challenging stressors for animal production due to high economic losses resulting from impaired animal’s productivity, health and welfare. Despite the fact that all farm animal species are susceptible to heat stress, birds and pigs are particularly sensitive to heat stress due to either lacking or non-functional sweat glands. Convincing evidence in the literature exists that gut dysbiosis, a term used to describe a perturbation of commensal gut microbiota, develops in broilers and pigs under heat stress. Owing to the protective role of commensal bacteria for the gut barrier, gut dysbiosis causes a disruption of the gut barrier leading to endotoxemia, which contributes to the typical characteristics of heat stressed broilers and growing and growing-finishing pigs, such as reduced feed intake, decreased growth and reduced lean carcass weight. A substantial number of studies have shown that feeding of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics is an efficacious strategy to protect broilers from heat stress-induced gut barrier disruption through altering the gut microbiota and promoting all decisive structural, biochemical, and immunological elements of the intestinal barrier. In most of the available studies in heat stressed broilers, the alterations of gut microbiota and improvements of gut barrier function induced by feeding of either probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics were accompanied by an improved productivity, health and/or welfare when compared to non-supplemented broilers exposed to heat stress. These findings indicate that the restoration of gut homeostasis and function is a key target for dietary interventions aiming to provide at least partial protection of broilers from the detrimental impact of heat stress conditions. Despite the fact that the number of studies dealing with the same feeding strategy in heat stressed pigs is limited, the available few studies suggest that feeding of probiotics might also be a suitable approach to enhance productivity, health and welfare in pigs kept under heat stress conditions.},

  abstract = {Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) can identify affected but asymptomatic infants. The selection of omic technique for gut microbiota study is crucial due to both the small amount of feces available and the low microorganism load. Our aims were to compare the agreement between 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and metaproteomics by a robust statistical analysis, including both presence and abundance of taxa, to describe the sequential establishment of the gut microbiota during the first year of life in a small size sample (8 infants and 28 fecal samples). The taxonomic assignations by the two techniques were similar, whereas certain discrepancies were observed in the abundance detection, mostly the lower predicted relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and the higher predicted relative abundance of certain Firmicutes and Proteobacteria by amplicon sequencing. During the first months of life, the CF gut microbiota is characterized by a significant enrichment of Ruminococcus gnavus, the expression of certain virulent bacterial traits, and the detection of human inflammation-related proteins. Metaproteomics provides information on composition and functionality, as well as data on host-microbiome interactions. Its strength is the identification and quantification of Actinobacteria and certain classes of Firmicutes, but alpha diversity indices are not comparable to those of amplicon sequencing. Both techniques detected an aberrant microbiota in our small cohort of infants with CF during their first year of life, dominated by the enrichment of R. gnavus within a human inflammatory environment. IMPORTANCE In recent years, some techniques have been incorporated for the study of microbial ecosystems, being 16S rRNA gene sequencing being the most widely used. Metaproteomics provides the advantage of identifying the interaction between microorganisms and human cells, but the available databases are less extensive as well as imprecise. Few studies compare the statistical differences between the two techniques to define the composition of an ecosystem. Our work shows that the two methods are comparable in terms of microorganism identification but provide different results in alpha diversity analysis. On the other hand, we have studied newborns with cystic fibrosis, for whom we have described the establishment of an intestinal ecosystem marked by the inflammatory response of the host and the enrichment of Ruminococcus gnavus.},

Gut microbes and their interactions with hosts play a crucial role in disease pathogenesis and progression. These interactions are complex, spanning multiple physiological systems and data types, making comprehensive disease assessment difficult, and often overwhelming single-omic capabilities. Stool-based multi-omics is a promising approach for characterizing host-gut microbiome interactions using deep integration of technologies such as 16S rRNA sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, meta-transcriptomics, metabolomics, and metaproteomics. The wealth of information generated through multi-omic studies is poised to usher in advancements in IBD research and precision medicine. This review highlights historical and recent findings from stool-based muti-omic studies that have contributed to unraveling IBD’s complexity. Finally, we discuss common pitfalls, issues, and limitations, and how future pipelines should address them to standardize multi-omics in IBD research and beyond.},

  abstract = {Despite the negative impacts of               Salmonella               intestinal colonization on human health,               Salmonella               is a natural colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract and is not overtly pathogenic to the avian host. It is of interest to understand the impacts and colonization rates of               Salmonella               across selected genetic lines such as slow-growing (SG) and conventional (CONV) broilers. The objective of this study was to characterize the relationship between               Salmonella enterica               serovar Typhimurium challenge and selected broiler genetic lines on the ileal and cecal microbiome. Male chicks of two broiler breeds (               n               = 156/breed) were cohoused in an open floor pen until day 7. On day 13, the chicks were then separated into 12 isolators per breed (4 rooms, 6 isolators/room, 11 chicks/isolator). On day 14, chicks in the 12 treatment isolators (6 isolators/breed, 108 total) were challenged with               Salmonella               Typhimurium (ST) (1 ×                                                                                                                        10                                              8                                                                                       CFU/ml) via oral gavage while the remaining chicks (               n               = 108) were given an oral gavage of sterile tryptic soy broth control (C). Ileal and cecal contents were collected on day 7 from 24 chicks of each breed, and on days 13, 17, 21, and 24 from two chicks per isolator. Samples underwent DNA extraction and PCR amplification to obtain 16S rRNA amplicons that were sequenced with Illumina MiSeq.               Salmonella               Typhimurium colonization in the cecum was not different in the two broiler breeds. The main effect of breed had the greatest impact on the ileum microbiota of broilers 7~days of age where SG broilers had significantly lower diversity and richness compared to CONV broilers (               p               \&lt; 0.05).               Salmonella               Typhimurium challenge consistently caused a change in beta diversity. Regardless of day or intestinal location, challenged broilers had many amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with decreased abundance of likely beneficial bacteria such as               Mollicutes               RF39,               Shuttleworthia               ,               Flavonifractor               , and               Oscillibacter               compared to broilers that were unchallenged with               Salmonella               Typhimurium (               p               \&lt; 0.05). Additionally, there was a difference in the timing of when the microbiota alpha and beta diversity of each breed responded to               Salmonella               Typhimurium challenge. Thus, both broiler breed and               Salmonella               Typhimurium can impact the intestinal microbiota.},

Chickens harbour unique and diverse bacterial communities that include human and animal pathogens. Increasing public concern about the use of antibiotics in the poultry industry has influenced the ways in which poultry producers are working towards improving birds’ intestinal health. Effective means of antibiotic-independent pathogen control through competitive exclusion and promotion of good protective microbiota are being actively investigated. With the realisation that just about any change in environment influences the highly responsive microbial communities and with the abandonment of the notion that we can isolate and investigate a single species of interest outside of the community, came a flood of studies that have attempted to profile the intestinal microbiota of chickens under numerous conditions. This review aims to address the main issues in investigating chicken microbiota and to summarise the data acquired to date.},

  abstract = {Avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), one of the widespread zoonotic-pathogen, can cause a series of diseases collectively known as colibacillosis. This disease can cause thousands of million dollars economic loss each year in poultry industry and threaten to human health via meat or egg contamination. However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying APEC infection is still not fully understood. Circular RNAs, a new type of endogenous noncoding RNA, have been demonstrated to involve in various biological processes. However, it is still not clear whether the circRNAs participate in host response against APEC infection. Herein, we utilized the high-throughput sequence technology to identify the circRNA expression profiles in APEC infected HD11 cells. A total of 49 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs were detected in the comparison of APEC infected HD11 cells vs. wild type HD11 cells, which were involved in MAPK signaling pathway, Endocytosis, Focal adhesion, mTOR signaling pathway, and VEGF signaling pathway. Specifically, the source genes (BRAF, PPP3CB, BCL2L13, RAB11A, and TSC2) and their corresponding DE circRNAs may play a significant role in APEC infection. Moreover, based on ceRNA regulation, we constructed the circRNA-miRNA network and identified a couple of important regulatory relationship pairs related to APEC infection, including circRAB11A-gga-miR-125b-3p, circRAB11A-gga-miR-1696, and circTSC2-gga-miR-1649-5p. Results indicate that the aforementioned specific circRNAs and circRNA-miRNA network might have important role in regulating host immune response against APEC infection. This study is the first time to investigate the circRNAs expression profile and the biological function of the source genes of the identified DE circRNAs after APEC infection of chicken HD11 cells. These results would contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms in host response against APEC infection.},

We enrolled ASD (n\,=\,26) and neurotypical subjects (n\,=\,26) with their oral hygiene controlled, and the metagenomes of both oral and fecal samples (n\,=\,104) are shotgun-sequenced and compared. We observe extensive and diverse oral phageome comparable to that of the gut, and clear signals of mouth-to-gut phage strain transfer within individuals. However, the overall phageomes of the two sites are widely different and show even less similarity in the oral communities between ASD and control subjects. The ASD oral phageome exhibits significantly reduced abundance and alpha diversity, but the Streptococcal phages there are atypically enriched, often dominating the community. The over-representation of Streptococcal phages is accompanied by enriched oral Streptococcal virulence factors and Streptococcus bacteria, all exhibiting a positive correlation with the severity of ASD clinical manifestations. These changes are not observed in the parallel sampling of the gut flora, suggesting a previously unknown oral-specific association between the excessive Streptococcal phage enrichment and ASD pathogenesis. The findings provide new evidence for the independent microbiome-mouth-brain connection, deepen our understanding of how the growth dynamics of bacteriophages and oral microbiota contribute to ASD, and point to novel effective therapeutics.},

  abstract = {In shotgun metagenomics (SM), the state-of-the-art bioinformatic workflows are referred to as high-resolution shotgun metagenomics (HRSM) and require intensive computing and disk storage resources. While the increase in data output of the latest iteration of high-throughput DNA sequencing systems can allow for unprecedented sequencing depth at a minimal cost, adjustments in HRSM workflows will be needed to properly process these ever-increasing sequence datasets. One potential adaptation is to generate so-called shallow SM datasets that contain fewer sequencing data per sample as compared with the more classic high coverage sequencing. While shallow sequencing is a promising avenue for SM data analysis, detailed benchmarks using real-data are lacking. In this case study, we took four public SM datasets, one massive and the others moderate in size and subsampled each dataset at various levels to mimic shallow sequencing datasets of various sequencing depths. Our results suggest that shallow SM sequencing is a viable avenue to obtain sound results regarding microbial community structures and that high-depth sequencing does not bring additional elements for ecological interpretation. More specifically, results obtained by subsampling as little as 0.5~M sequencing clusters per sample were similar to the results obtained with the largest subsampled dataset for human gut and agricultural soil datasets. For an Antarctic dataset, which contained only a few samples, 4~M sequencing clusters per sample was found to generate comparable results to the full dataset. One area where ultra-deep sequencing and maximizing the usage of all data was undeniably beneficial was in the generation of metagenome-assembled genomes.},

  abstract = {Spotty Liver Disease (SLD) is a serious infectious disease which occurs mainly in laying chickens in free range production systems. SLD outbreaks can increase mortality and decrease egg production of chickens, adversely impact welfare and cause economic hardship for poultry producers. The bacterium               Campylobacter hepaticus               is the primary cause of the disease. This study aimed to identify the effects of               C. hepaticus               on chicken gut microbiota and gut structure. Three               C. hepaticus               strains (HV10               T               , NSW44L and QLD19L), isolated from different states of Australia, were used in the study. Chickens at 26-weeks post-hatch were orally dosed with one of the               C. hepaticus               strains (challenged groups) or Brucella broth (unchallenged or control group). Six days after the challenge, birds were necropsied to assess liver damage, and caecal content and tissue samples were collected for histology, microbiology, and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the composition of the bacterial microbiota. Strain               C. hepaticus               NSW44L produced significantly more disease compared to the other               C. hepaticus               strains and this coincided with more adverse changes observed in the caecal microbiota of the birds challenged with this strain compared to the control group. Microbial diversity determined by Shannon and Simpson alpha diversity indices was lower in the NSW44L challenged groups compared to the control group (               p               = 0.009 and 0.0233 respectively, at genus level). Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing bacteria               Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium               and               Megamonas               were significantly reduced in the challenged groups compared to the unchallenged control group. Although SLD-induction affected the gut microbiota of chickens, their small intestine morphology was not noticeably affected as there were no significant differences in the villus height or ratio of villus height and crypt depth. As gut health plays a pivotal role in the overall health and productivity of chickens, approaches to improve the gut health of the birds during SLD outbreaks such as through diet and keeping the causes of stress to a minimum, may represent significant ways to alleviate the impact of SLD.},

In order to guide future animal gut microbiota research projects and standardization efforts, we have conducted a systematic comparison of 10 currently used sample preservation and DNA extraction approaches for pig and chicken microbiota samples and quantified their effects on bacterial DNA yield, quality, integrity, and on the resulting sequence-based bacterial composition estimates. The results showed how key stages of conducting a microbiota study, including the sample storage and DNA extraction, can substantially affect DNA recovery from the microbial community, and therefore, biological interpretation in a matrix-dependent manner. Our results highlight the fact that the influence of storage and extraction methods on the resulting microbial community structure differed by sample type, even within the same species. As the effects of these technical steps are potentially large compared with the real biological variability to be explained, standardization is crucial for accelerating progress in the area of livestock microbiota research. This study provided a framework to assist future animal gut microbiota research projects and standardization efforts.},

  abstract = {16S rRNA gene sequencing for characterization of microbiomes has become more common in poultry research and can be used to both answer specific research questions and help inform experimental design choices. The objective of this study was to use 16S rRNA gene sequencing to examine common sampling practices in broiler chicken studies such as: the required number of birds selected from a flock to adequately capture microbiome diversity, the differences between cecal pairs within the same bird, and whether cloacal swabs are representative of other alimentary tract (AT) locations. To do this, nine market age broilers were euthanized and immediately sampled in ten AT locations: crop, gizzard, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecal samples from each pouch, colon, and cloacal swab. DNA was extracted and subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. Each location within the broiler AT hosts distinct microbial communities. When each sampling location was considered, it was found that sampling after 2.8 birds (range 2–4) resulted in less than 10\% new amplicon sequencing variants (ASV) being added while sampling after 7.6 birds (range 6–10) increases new observed ASVs by less than 1\%. Additionally, when cecal pairs from the same bird were evaluated, it was found that cecal pair mates are an adequate replication if interested in the total cecal microbiome but may be less useful if a rare lineage is of interest. Furthermore, when compared to other AT locations, the cecal microbiome was enriched in Firmicutes and Bacteroides while several lineages, most notably Lactobacillus, were under-represented. Finally, when cloacal swabs were compared to other AT locations, community similarity exhibited a direct distance relationship, i.e., the more aborad samples were the more similar they were to the swab. These findings indicate that while cloacal swabs can approximate overall changes in microbiome composition, they are not adequate for inferring changes to specific taxa in other parts of the AT tract—even those that are highly abundant within the microbial community. These data provide new insights guiding appropriate sample size selection within flocks and add to the consensus data regarding cecal pair similarity and destructive versus non-destructive sampling methods.},

  abstract = {The eastern part of Hainan, China, has a flat terrain and a suitable climate with abundant sunshine and rain. This unique environment makes the tropical microbial resources of natural fermented food unique and rich. Therefore, we combined Shotgun metagenomic sequencing, 16S rRNA sequencing and pure culture technology to analyze the microbial diversity, microbiota composition, species differences and correlation of 30 traditional fermented food samples collected from Wenchang, Qionghai, Wanning and Lingshui in the eastern part of Hainan province, and isolated, identified and preserved the microorganisms in them. The results showed that the microbial community structure differs significantly between samples from different regions and between different substrates. The alpha diversity of microorganisms in traditional fermented foods in the Wanning area was higher than those of the other three areas. The beta diversity indicated that the microbiota structural difference between Wanning and Qionghai was smaller. This is consistent with the fact that the precipitation in the Wanning area is the highest and similar to that of Qionghai. The alpha diversity of microorganisms was the highest in fermented vegetables, followed by fermented grains, and the lowest in fermented seafood. Beta diversity showed that the microbiota composition of fermented grains and fermented vegetables is very similar, but that of fermented seafood is significantly different. The results of microbiota structural analysis showed that firmicutes and proteobacteria are the dominant bacterial phyla, and Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum are the dominant species in traditional fermented foods in eastern Hainan. Lactic acid bacteria are the dominant species in traditional fermented foods from the eastern Hainan region of China, regardless of the substrate used in fermentation. According to the microbial functional characteristics, the microbial metabolism and biosynthesis pathways in traditional fermented foods in Hainan tend to be active. In addition, combined with pure culture technology, we isolated, identified and preserved 342 lactic acid bacteria strains from traditional fermented food in eastern Hainan province. This study helped us understand the different characteristics of microbial communities in tropical southern China and supplement the Lactobacillus species resource pool in tropical southern China. Moreover, it provided new insights and directions for the development and utilization of fermented foods.},

One hundred and twenty 49-day-old healthy dewormed Luhua chickens were randomly divided into four groups with three replicates per group and ten chickens per replicate. The corn–quinoa and soybean meal diets were supplemented with 0 (Q8 group), 50 (QO50 group), 100 (QO100 group) and 150 mg·kg−1 (QO150 group) of oregano essential oil, respectively, and the experiment lasted for 75 days. The composition of intestinal flora was detected by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region, and the composition and content of fatty acids in the muscles were analyzed by gas chromatography. The results showed that dietary oregano essential oil can effectively increase the contents of elaidic acid (C18:ln9t), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) in breast muscle tissues. However, the fatty acid composition and PUFA content in leg muscle tissues were not significantly improved. According to a 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing analysis, dietary oregano essential oil supplementation with a certain concentration can change the cecal microbial community composition of broilers. At the phylum level, Elusimicrobia in the QO150 group was significantly lower than that in Q8 group (p {$<$} 0.05). At the genus level, Phascolarctobacterium, Parasutterella and Bilophila in the experimental groups (QO50, QO100 and QO150) were significantly lower than those in the Q8 group (p {$<$} 0.05). An enrichment analysis of the microbial function found that the amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, metabolism, signal transduction and genetic information processing were mainly enriched in the experimental groups, which promoted the digestion and absorption of nutrients and enhanced intestinal barrier functioning. An analysis of the association between fatty acids and microbes found that the abundance of microbiota was significantly correlated with partially saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) (p {$<$} 0.05). In conclusion, the dietary addition of oregano essential oil can effectively improve cecal microbial community composition, promote the digestion and absorption of nutrients, and enhance intestinal barrier functioning. It can significantly improve the content of some fatty acids, and there was a certain correlation between caecum microorganisms and fatty acid deposition in muscles.},

  abstract = {Domestic chickens are valuable sources of protein associated with producing meat and eggs for humans. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) houses a large microbial community, and these microbiota play an important role in growth and health of chickens, contributing to the enhancement of nutrient absorption and improvement of the birds’ immune systems. To improve our understanding of the chicken intestinal microbial composition, microbiota inhabiting 5 different intestinal locations (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon) of 42-day-old broiler chickens were detected based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. As a result, 1,502,554 sequences were clustered into 796 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 97\% sequence similarity value and identified into 15 phyla and 288 genera. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Cyanobacteria were the major microbial groups and Firmicutes was the dominant phylum in duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon accounting for {$>$} 60\% of sequences, while Bacteroidetes was the dominant phylum in cecum ({$>$}50\% of sequences), but little in the other four gut sections. At the genus level, the major microbial genera across all gut sections were Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Bacteroides, and Corynebacterium. Lactobacillus was the predominant genus in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum ({$>$}35\%), but was rarely present in cecum, and Bacteroides was the most dominant group in cecum (about 40\%), but rarely present in the other 4 intestinal sections. Differences of microbial composition between the 5 intestinal locations might be a cause and consequence of gut functional differences and may also reflect host selection mediated by innate or adaptive immune responses. All these results could offer some information for the future study on the relationship between intestinal microbiota and broiler chicken growth performance as well as health.},

  abstract = {Tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) with multiple incentives is a metabolic skeletal disease that occurs in fast-growing broilers. Perturbations in the gut microbiota (GM) have been shown to affect bone homoeostasis, but the mechanisms by which GM modulates bone metabolism in TD broilers remain unknown. Here, using a broiler model of TD, we noted elevated blood glucose (GLU) levels in TD broilers, accompanied by alterations in the pancreatic structure and secretory function and damaged intestinal barrier function. Importantly, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) of gut microbes from normal donors rehabilitated the GM and decreased the elevated GLU levels in TD broilers. A high GLU level is a predisposing factor to bone disease, suggesting that GM dysbiosis-mediated hyperglycaemia might be involved in bone regulation. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and short-chain fatty acid analysis revealed that the significantly increased level of the metabolite butyric acid derived from the genera Blautia and Coprococcus regulated GLU levels in TD broilers by binding to GPR109A in the pancreas. Tibial studies showed reduced expression of vascular regulatory factors (including PI3K, AKT and VEFGA) based on transcriptomics analysis and reduced vascular distribution, contributing to nonvascularization of cartilage in the proximal tibial growth plate of TD broilers with elevated GLU levels. Additionally, treatment with the total flavonoids from Rhizoma drynariae further validated the improvement in bone homoeostasis in TD broilers by regulating GLU levels through the regulation of GM to subsequently improve intestinal and pancreatic function. These findings clarify the critical role of GM-mediated changes in GLU levels via the gut–pancreas axis in bone homoeostasis in TD chickens.},

  abstract = {The poultry industry has become a global leader in livestock farming over the past few decades. Poultry production has a large consumer market as an integrated industry producing high-protein foods.           ,              ABSTRACT                            The chicken gut microbiota plays an influential role in nutrient absorption and metabolism. A clear picture of microbiota succession can enhance host nutrition and disease resistance. This study investigated the cecal microbiota succession of broilers between 3 and 42\,days after hatching using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analyzed its potential association with intestinal nutrient metabolism. Microbiota structure differed significantly at different time points depending on the microbiota alpha-diversity or beta-diversity.               Proteobacteria               and               Bacteroidetes               promoted succession on days 3 to 7 and days 28 to 35, respectively.               Firmicutes               and               Tenericutes               maintained homeostasis on days 7 to 28 and days 35 to 42.               Shigella               , [               Ruminococcus               ],               Erysipelotrichaceae\_Clostridium               , and               Coprobacillus               promoted succession on days 3 to 7;               Faecalibacterium               modified microbial composition on days 7 to 14;               Faecalibacterium               and               Bacteroides               regulated microbial structure from days 21 to 28. The microbiota structure was relatively stable on days 14 to 21 and days 28 to 35. Spearman’s correlation analysis indicated a positive correlation between               Lactobacillus               and villus height and crypt depth (               P\,{$<$}\,               0.01).               Faecalibacterium               and               Shigella               were correlated with propionate, butyrate, and valerate concentrations (               P\,{$<$}\,               0.01).               Ruminococcus               was correlated with sodium-glucose cotransporters 1 and cationic amino acid transporter 1 expression (               P\,{$<$}\,               0.05).               Erysipelotrichaceae\_Clostridium               and               Shigella               were positively correlated with serum levels of total cholesterol, tryglucerides, and high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (               P\,{$<$}\,               0.01).               Bacteroides               ,               Parabacteroides               ,               Lactobacillus               , and               Shigella               were correlated with serum VB6 levels (               P\,{$<$}\,               0.01).               Bacteroides               ,               Erysipelotrichaceae\_Clostridium               , and               Coprobacillus               were correlated with the moisture content of cecal contents (               P\,{$<$}\,               0.05). The identification of the microbiota in correlation with nutrient metabolism will promote microbial nutrition through microbiota intervention or nutritional regulation.                                         IMPORTANCE               The poultry industry has become a global leader in livestock farming over the past few decades. Poultry production has a large consumer market as an integrated industry producing high-protein foods. Establishing the association between microbiota and nutrient metabolism processes provides fresh insights for precise nutrient regulation. This study aimed to describe the development of cecal microbiota in broiler chickens throughout the production cycle and to assess the correlation of nutrient metabolism phenotypes with temporal changes in the microbiota. The results suggested that changes in cecal microbes with age partly explain changes in gut nutrient metabolic processes, and numerous microbes were significantly associated with the processes. Therefore, this study attempts to further find efficient ways of improving poultry production. One is to promote nutrient metabolism by identifying potential candidates for probiotics, and another is to foster the dominant colonization of the microbiota by regulating nutrient metabolism.},

  abstract = {Due to the importance of chicken production and the remarkable influence of the gut microbiota on host health and growth, tens of thousands of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) have been constructed for the chicken gut microbiome. However, due to the limitations of short-read sequencing and assembly technologies, most of these MAGs are far from complete, are of lower quality, and include contaminant reads.We generated 332 Gb of high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads from the 5 chicken intestinal compartments and assembled 461 and 337 microbial genomes, of which 53\% and 55\% are circular, at the species and strain levels, respectively. For the assembled microbial genomes, approximately 95\% were regarded as complete according to the “RNA complete” criteria, which requires at least 1 full-length ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operon encoding all 3 types of rRNA (16S, 23S, and 5S) and at least 18 copies of full-length transfer RNA genes. In comparison with the short-read-derived chicken MAGs, 384 (83\% of 461) and 89 (26\% of 337) strain-level and species-level genomes in this study are novel, with no matches to previously reported sequences. At the gene level, one-third of the 2.5 million genes in the HiFi-derived gene catalog are novel and cannot be matched to the short-read-derived gene catalog. Moreover, the HiFi-derived genomes have much higher continuity and completeness, as well as lower contamination; the HiFi-derived gene catalog has a much higher ratio of complete gene structures. The dominant phylum in our HiFi-assembled genomes was Firmicutes (82.5\%), and the foregut was highly enriched in 5 genera: Ligilactobacillus, Limosilactobacillus, Lactobacillus, Weissella, and Enterococcus, all of which belong to the order Lactobacillales. Using GTDB-Tk, all 337 species-level genomes were successfully classified at the order level; however, 2, 35, and 189 genomes could not be classified into any known family, genus, and species, respectively. Among these incompletely classified genomes, 9 and 49 may belong to novel genera and species, respectively, because their 16S rRNA genes have identities lower than 95\% and 97\% to any known 16S rRNA genes.HiFi sequencing not only produced metagenome assemblies and gene structures with markedly improved quality but also recovered a substantial portion of novel genomes and genes that were missed in previous short-read-based metagenome studies. The novel genomes and species obtained in this study will facilitate gut microbiome and host–microbiota interaction studies, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of poultry resources.},

  abstract = {Ammonia is a toxic air pollutant that causes severe respiratory tract injury in animals and humans. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been found to be involved in the development of respiratory tract injury induced by air pollutants, however, the specific mechanism requires investigation. Here, we found that, inhaled ammonia induced tracheal injury by reducing expression of claudin-1, increasing expression of muc5ac, TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10), and also altering tracheal microbiota composition. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that gut microbiota dysbiosis positively correlated with TLR4 level in the trachea. Antibiotic depletion intestinal microbiota treatment reduced the severity of ammonia-induced tracheal injury via TLR4 signaling pathway. Microbiota transplantation induced the tracheal injury via TLR4 signaling pathway even without the ammonia exposure. These results indicate that gut microbiota dysbiosis exaggerates ammonia-induced tracheal injury via TLR4 signaling pathway. In addition, the [Ruminococcus]\_torques\_group, Faecalibacterium, unclassified\_f\_Lachnospiraceae may be the key gut microbiota contributing to the alterations of tracheal microbiota composition.},
