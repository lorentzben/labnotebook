“At phylum level, Actinobacteria was significantly enriched in W36 at all time points while Synergistetes (53 weeks), Spirochaetes (58 weeks), and Synergistetes and Spirochaetes (67 weeks) were significantly higher in HB” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 1)
\par
“The effect of housing and strains was not only seen at the bacterial composition and structure but also reflected at their functional level. Notably, KEGG metabolic pathways predicted to be involved in carbohydrates degradation and amino acids biosynthesis by PICRUSt analysis were significantly different between W36 and HB housed at CC and EC. In sum, cecal microbiota composition, diversities, and their functional pathways were affected by housing type which further varied between two commercial laying hen strains, HB and W36. This suggests that both housing and genetic strains of laying hens should be considered for selection of the alternative housing systems such as enriched colony cage.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 1)
\par
“IMPORTANCE” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2) This is an interesting section
\par
“Although previous studies have investigated the performance parameters and welfare of laying hens housed in CC and EC cages, there is very limited information regarding the changes in gut microbiota, particularly in ceca. Our research findings will be important to the primary breeders to help in the decision-making process to select certain types of breed for the specific housing environmen” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2)

“Poultry industry is the fastest-growing industry which is expected to grow continuously since the demand for meat and eggs is continuously increasing as a result of growing human population (1).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2) Its always about: feeding the world
\par
“Traditionally, people focused mainly on the strategies to maximize the profit and productivity of poultry, and conventional cage (CC) system is one of those strategies developed during the 1930s and has been used in the traditional egg production since 1950s (3)” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2)
\par
“The negative impacts of CC are mainly due to the limited space for movement that can cause musculoskeletal weakness, and low complexities of the environment, which can abolish many of their natural behaviors such as nesting, roosting, dust bathing, perching, and foraging (6–8).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2)
\par
“As an alternative, enriched colony cages (CC) were developed that provide more space for movement and comfort behaviors, and may allow for some dust bathing, nesting, foraging, and perching (11)” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2)
\par
“Furthermore, it has been shown that host factors such as breeds or strains within the same environment can affect the intestinal microbiota in chicken (13).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2)
\par
“Hens were reared in top two tiers of three-tiered A-frame type conventional cage (CC; dimension: 1.6′ x 2′) and both tiers of two-tired enriched colony cage (EC; dimension: 4′ x 12′; Chore-Time Inc.,) at Mississippi State University Poultry Research Farm located in Starkville, MS.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2)

“Nebula cloud computing platform of the University of Arkansas was used to process raw sequencing reads in QIIME 2 versio” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 3)
\par
“2018.8 (17) utilizing the pipelines developed for paired-end data types. In sum, “demux emp-paired” method of q2-demux plugin was used to demultiplex sequencing reads followed by quality filtering and denoising with “dada2 denoise-paired” method of q2-dada2 (18) plugin available at QIIME 2. The truncation length of forward and reverse reads was set at 240 and 200 bp, respectively, which is based on the quality score criteria (≥30). Taxonomic assignments was performed using a Naive Bayes classifier (19) pre-trained with Greengenes (Version 13.8) 99\% OTUs (20) and q2-feature-classifier plugin, where the sequences have been trimmed to include only the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene bound by the 515F/806R primer pair. The coremetrics-phylogenetic method at a sampling depth of 31,060 was used to analyze Alpha and Beta diversity. Shannon’s diversity index (21) and UnWeighted UniFrac distance metric (22) were used to calculate alpha and beta diversity, respectively. All figures including Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) plot were created from ggplot2 package of R (23).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 4)

“Statistical differences among treatment groups at different taxonomic assignments were calculated using LEfSe (24) using criteria, P {$<$} 0.05, LDA score {$>$} 2.0. While comparing taxa between two hen strains, hen strains were used as Class and Housing types were used as subclass. Likewise, Housing types were used as Class and hen strains as subclass while comparing taxa between housing types. The significant differences in alpha diversity were calculated using the alpha-group-significance command of QIIME2 which uses Kruskal-Wallis test. On the contrary, statistical differences in beta diversity among groups were calculated by PERMANOVA test (25) using the beta-groupsignificance command of QIIME2 with pairwise comparison option. For both diversity analyses, the corrected P-values for multiple comparisons (q) were used to report a significant difference between two groups, where the level of significance was set at q {$<$} 0.05. PICRUSt2 (26) was used to predict the metabolic pathways of cecal microbiota, and MetaCyc database (27) was used to describe the predicted pathways. Differentially” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 4)

“abundant features were identified using Welch’s t-test built-in STAMP software (28), where features were filtered using P {$<$} 0.05 and difference in mean proportions (\%) {$<$}0.03 criteria.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 5)
\par
“Summarization of the feature table resulted in 5,568,578 sequence reads from 90 samples that ranged from 31,060 to 88,097 reads per sample. The median and mean±SE reads per sample were 63,893.50 and 61,873.09 ± 1,270.94, respectively. In addition, there were altogether 1,759 unique features (amplicon sequence variants) from these 90 samples. The summary of average reads per sample in different groups is summarized in Table 2.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 5)

“In addition, 0.01\% of total sequence reads were assigned to Kingdom Bacteria but not to the lower level of the taxonomy. Among those phyla, Bacteroidetes (49.05\%) was the predominant phylum followed by Firmicutes (45.05\%). Other important phyla with relative abundance greater than 0.2\% included Actinobacteria (2.70\%), Proteobacteria (0.77\%), Spirochaetes (0.52\%), Synergistetes (0.41\%), and WPS-2 (0.34\%). The relative abundance levels of major phyla that were presented in two different housing types at four different time points are shown in Figure 1” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 5)
\par
“The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was the highest followed by Firmicutes in both HB and W36 irrespective of housing types and ages, except in W36 hens housed in CC housing at 67 weeks where the Firmicutes (51.96\%) was found as the predominant phylum (Figure 1). Likewise, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria was found higher especially in W36 irrespective of housing as shown in Figure 1” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 5)

“W36 housed at EC at 53 and 58 weeks, where Prevotella (16.13\%) and Lactobacillus (15.65\%) were the predominant genera in respective ages (Figure 2). The relative abundance of Prevotella ranged from 5.49 to 9.78\% in HB (Figure 2; left half), whereas it ranged from 8.62 to 16.13\% in W36 (Figure 2; right half)” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 7)

“Similarly, the relative abundance of Ruminococcus ranged from 4.83 to 9.75\% in HB, while it ranged from 5.93 to 9.84\% in W36” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 7)
\par
“In addition, Lactobacillus ranged from 2.59 to 4.72\% in HB, but it ranged from 2.35 to 15.65\% in W36. Another important observation was the genus Megamonas which was found the highest (13.75\%) in W36 housed at 67 weeks in CC housing.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 7)
\par
“The strain effect was more pronounced than housing effect, and the bacterial taxa that were differentially abundant between W36 and HB strains at 53, 58, 67, and 72 weeks are shown in Figures 3–6, respectively” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 7)

“The genus Bifidobacterium was significantly enriched in W36 as compared to HB throughout all time points. In addition, Butyricicoccus (except, 67 weeks), unidentified genera of phylum Actinobacteria (except, 67 weeks), Bulleidia and Pseudoramibacter-Eubacterium (except 72 weeks) were significantly higher in W36 at all time points. Other notable genera that were significantly abundant in W36 were Candidatus Arthromitus (except 58 and 67 weeks) and Subdoligranulum (except 53 and 67 weeks) as shown in Figures 3–6. Moreover, Prevotella, Collinsella, Flexispira, and Slackia were presented significantly higher in W36 only at 58 weeks (Figure 4), whereas Succinatimonas was presented significantly higher only at 72 weeks (Figure 6” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 7)
\par
“In addition, the genus Akkermansia, and the unidentified genera that belong to phylum Synergistetes, and that belong to family Christensenellaceae were also significantly higher in HB at all time points except at 72 weeks” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 7)
\par
“Interestingly, some of the archaeal taxa were also found to be differentially presented between two strains of laying hens throughout all time points except at 72 weeks. Methanobrevibacter and 3 unknown genera that were assigned as Methanobacteria, Methanobacteriales, and Methanobacteriaceae, respectively, were significantly higher in W36 at 53 and 58 weeks, while unknown genera that were assigned as Methanomicrobia, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanocorpusculaceae were significantly higher in HB (except 72 weeks)” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 7)

In addition, bacterial genera such as Ruminococcus, Corynebacterium, Sutterella, and the unknown genera that were assigned at order Burkholderiales and Actinomycetales, and family Corynebacteriaceae and Alcaligenaceae were significantly abundant in EC at 53 weeks.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 8)
\par
“The alpha diversity was highly affected by strains in comparison to housing. The alpha diversities in HB strain was significantly higher as compared to W36 throughout all four ages as shown in Figure 14. The alpha diversity increased with increase in age of both strains which was more noticeable in HB, where the alpha diversity of HB strain at 72 weeks was significantly higher in comparison to HB at 53 weeks of age as shown in Figure 11.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 10)

“The PERMANOVA results showed that the microbial community structure in laying hens was significantly affected by all three variable analyzed; age (P = 0.028), housing (P = 0.001), and strain (P = 0.001).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 11)
\par
“Pairwise PERMANOVA results showed that there was a tendency of microbial community structure difference between EC and CC throughout four ages, significant difference between EC and CC was observed only at 67 weeks of age. This is in accordance with the results in alpha diversity.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 11)
\par
“Furthermore, in agreement with taxonomic composition and alpha diversity, the strain effect was most prominent on beta diversity among other variables since there was significant difference in beta diversity between HB and W36 throughout all four ages (adjusted P {$<$} 0.05).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 11)
\par
“On the contrary to housing, increase in age resulted in significant difference in beta diversity even within the same strains, which was more noticeable in HB (53 vs. 67, 58 vs. 67 and 72, and 67 vs. 72) than W36 (53 vs. 67).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 11)

“Moreover, the cecal microbiota community structure was affected by housing types in both HB (Figure 14) and W36 hens (Figure 15) at P {$<$} 0.00” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 11)
\par
“age, housing, and strain not only affected community diversity but also affected the functional diversity of cecal microbiota (P {$<$} 0.001).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12)
\par
“On the contrary, housing types affected functional diversity more than the community structure, where there was significant difference in functional diversity between CC and EC at both 67 and 72 weeks (PERMANOVA pairwise, P {$<$} 0.05).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12)
\par
“Among 17 differentially abundant pathways between HB and W36, 13 pathways were significantly enriched in W36 while 4 pathways were significantly enriched in HB” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12)
\par
“In W36, metabolic pathways related to TCA cycle, sucrose degradation, hexitol fermentation (lactate, formate, and ethanol), amino” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12)
\par
“acids biosynthesis (arginine, L-phenylalanine, and L-tyrosine), the Bifidobacterium shunt, and peptidoglycan biosynthesis were significantly enriched in W36. On the other hand, pathways related to pyruvate fermentation to acetone, and biotin synthesis, palmitate biosynthesis were highly abundant in HB (Figure 17).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12)
\par
“In HB group, altogether 22 metabolic pathways (8 in CC and 14 in EC) were differentially presented between CC and EC housing systems after filtering pathways with P {$>$} 0.05 (Welch’s t-test) and effect size (\% difference in mean proportions) {$<$}0.03 using STAMP (Figure 18).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12)
\par
“Specifically, pathways of TCA cycle, amino acid biosynthesis (L-serine and L-glycine), starch degradation, adenosylcobalamin (also known as vitamin B12 or coenzyme B12) biosynthesis, and 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin diphosphate biosynthesis (precursor of vitamin B9 synthesis) were significantly enriched in CC group, whereas pathways of glycerol degradation, methanogenesis, amino acid biosynthesis (L-lysine, L-threonine, L-methionine, and L-aspartate), and purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis were significantly enriched in EC group.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12)
\par
“W36 group, altogether 37 metabolic pathways (22 in CC and 15 in EC) were differentially presented between CC and EC housing systems as shown in Figure 1” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12)
\par
“Like in the HB group, pathways of TCA cycle and 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin diphosphate biosynthesis (precursor of vitamin B9 synthesis) were significantly higher in CC group, while pathways of purine nucleotide and amino acids (L-lysine and L-aspartate) biosynthesis in EC group. On the contrary, biosynthesis pathways of amino acids such as L-ornithine, L-tryptophan, L-arginine, L-tyrosine, L-histidine, and L-phenylalanine were significantly enriched in CC group.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12)
\par
“Another important observation was significant enrichment of glycolysis, acid fermentation and” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12)
\par
“Bifidobacterium shunt pathway in EC group, while significant enrichment of pathways associated with various vitamins biosyntheses such as K2 (menaquinol-8 biosynthesis) and B12 (tetrapyrrole biosynthesis I) was observed in CC group (Figure 19).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13)
\par
“In laying hens, different dietary supplementations such as threonine (29), rapeseed meal (30), probiotics (31–33), calcium (34), and flaxseed oil (35) have been found to modulate the intestinal microbiota. However, there is very limited information regarding the changes in intestinal microbiota composition of laying hens due to the housing systems.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13)
\par
“In the present study, we found changes in cecal microbiota composition, their diversities and predicted functional pathways in both laying hen strains raised in CC and EC housing systems during the late production stage.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13)
\par
“A previous study reported a higher number of Clostridium perfringens in ileum and cecum of broiler chickens raised on organic farms as compared to the conventional farms was observed (36)” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13)
\par
“lower count of C. perfringens in conventional farms might be achieved due to the application of Salinomycin in the conventional feed that has antibiotic properties. In addition, they found an increase in Lactobacilli, while a decrease in Enterobacteriaceae counts in the ileal contents of the chickens from organic farms (36).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13)
\par
“Another study reported enrichment of Bifidobacterium in both ileum and ceca of broiler chickens which were provided free daytime access to outdoor space as compared to those chickens which were kept at indoors range (37).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13)
\par
“Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was higher in cecum of cage-raised chickens, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes was higher in free-range chickens (38).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13)
\par
“we also reported the higher abundance of Bacteroidetes in EC where hens have more flexibility in movement and behavioral expression, while the higher abundance of Firmicutes in CC where they have restricted movement, especially at 67 weeks of age. In addition, we also reported significantly higher abundance of Proteobacteria in EC at 72 weeks of age in CC and EC.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13)
\par
“Many gramnegative pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Helicobacter, and Vibrio belong to the phylum Proteobacteria whose increase can be considered as a potential indicator of gut dysbiosis (39).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13)
\par
“This was also reflected at the genus level where Campylobacter and unknown genera of family Campylobacteraceae and Helicobacteraceae were significantly higher in EC at 72 weeks.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13)
\par
“More specifically, the alpha diversity was decreased in chickens housed in cages as compared to those from free-range. In addition, most of the KEGG pathways of cecal microbiota associated with various functions such as metabolism, alkaloid biosynthesis, and amino acids degradation were down-regulated in cages-reared chickens.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 14)
\par
“Likewise, several metabolic pathways were differentially enriched between CC and EC in the current study, which were further dependent on laying hen strains. For instance, 22 metabolic pathways (8 in CC and 14 in EC) were differentially abundant in HB strain, while 37 metabolic pathways (22 in CC and 15 in EC) in W36 strain, suggesting more pronounced effects of housing in W36.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 14)
\par
“Specifically, pathways related to energy and nucleotide metabolism, and amino acids and vitamin B biosynthesis were” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 14)
\par
“differentially presented between two housing systems in a straindependent manner.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 14)
\par
“The phylum Actinobacteria and its genus Bifidobacterium were significantly enriched in W36 as compared to the HB throughout all four-time points.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 14)
\par
“Specifically, bifidobacteria are well-known for their ability to ferment complex carbohydrates in the lower part of the intestine that bypasses the degradation in the upper parts through various carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (43). They can ferment diverse complex carbon sources including gastric mucin, (trans)-galactooligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, malto-oligosaccharides, fructo-oligosaccharides, pectin, soybean oligosaccharides, and other plant derived-oligosaccharides. However, their ability to degrade particular carbon source is species/strain-dependent (44). Through fermentation, bifidobacteria can degrade complex carbohydrates to monosaccharides which are further degraded to intermediates of the hexose fermentation pathway (also known as Bifidobacterium shunt or fructose-6-phosphate shunt) (45) and finally converted to short-chain fatty acids, especially acetate and lactate (42).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 14) Make a note of this "

  abstract = {The recent increase in publicly available metagenomic datasets with geospatial metadata has made it possible to determine location-specific, microbial fingerprints from around the world. Such fingerprints can be useful for comparing microbial niches for environmental research, as well as for applications within forensic science and public health. To determine the regional specificity for environmental metagenomes, we examined 4305 shotgun-sequenced samples from the MetaSUB Consortium dataset—the most extensive public collection of urban microbiomes, spanning 60 different cities, 30 countries, and 6 continents. We were able to identify city-specific microbial fingerprints using supervised machine learning (SML) on the taxonomic classifications, and we also compared the performance of ten SML classifiers. We then further evaluated the five algorithms with the highest accuracy, with the city and continental accuracy ranging from 85–89\% to 90–94\%, respectively. Thereafter, we used these results to develop Cassandra, a random-forest-based classifier that identifies bioindicator species to aid in fingerprinting and can infer higher-order microbial interactions at each site. We further tested the Cassandra algorithm on the Tara Oceans dataset, the largest collection of marine-based microbial genomes, where it classified the oceanic sample locations with 83\% accuracy. These results and code show the utility of SML methods and Cassandra to identify bioindicator species across both oceanic and urban environments, which can help guide ongoing efforts in biotracing, environmental monitoring, and microbial forensics (MF).},

“Outside of humanassociated ecosystems, microbial forensics (MF) could feasibly be used—in the oceans, for example—for tracking deleterious algal blooms or organisms with unknown migration patterns [14]. This would be complementary to existing approaches in which oceanographers use discarded host DNA to ascertain the presence of a given species [15].” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 2)
\par
“The goal of microbial forensics is to be able to identify the point of origin, provenance, or likely history of any given sample using microbial fingerprints: distinct microbiomes that can identify their place of origin [16].” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 2)
\par
“Additionally, Segata et al., 2011, developed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) method and used LDA-based methods for finding biomarkers, including phenotypic indicators from 16S samples [21].” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 2)
\par
“Ideally, metagenomic datasets could be used to develop discriminating microbial signatures or fingerprints, but there is a lack of universally accepted tools for identifying bioindicator species from metagenomics data [10,23].” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 2)
\par
“Here, we present Cassandra, an SML tool to address these unmet needs of metagenomicsbased microbial forensics, which can predict bioindicator species from shotgun sequence datasets.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 3)
\par
“We chose to use a Random Forest because it yields output that is simple to interpret, stable against Gaussian noise, does not overfit in unbalanced datasets, and the standard deviation between the various preprocessor methods is extremely low.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 5)
\par
“Cassandra first does an 80–20 train-test split, creates a new tree based on the training set, and trains the model. It evaluates the accuracy of the test set. If the desired accuracy is achieved, Cassandra selects the run and reports the attributed features (microbes) for the run. The algorithm keeps running till we have 1000 instances to achieve consensus (which can be modified by users) with the desired accuracy. The weight of all the species is reported for each of those instances, which helps us understand higher-level interaction between species and the geolocation. Furthermore, another output file is generated which selects the top n-species of interest (which can be user modifiers) of interest which are bioindicator species.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 5)
\par
“We next examined the output of Cassandra after this processing, which details the weight associated with each microbe for classification with minimum accuracy. We found that microbial abundance (the amount of a given microbe) and microbial prevalence (the number of samples where the microbes were found) had a linear relationship (Figure 3A).” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 9)
\par
“Out of the 31 core microbial taxa in the MetaSUB dataset, we observed 4 of them in the top 50 bioindicator species, namely: Streptococcus mitis, Brevundimonas sp. GW460, Brevundimonas naejangsanensis, Cutibacterium acnes.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 9)
\par
“Using the MetaSUB dataset, we next examined the ability to predict other forensic features, including surface material (e.g., metal, glass, plastic), temperature, climate, and other clues of sample provenance. To develop these methods, we trained the MetaSUB species data on eight unique features, including surface type, sampling type, coastal city, climate, and others (Table 3). Each feature was analyzed independently using 3 crossvalidation methods (k-fold, leave one group out for the city, and one for the continent), which repeatedly uses part of the samples for learning the model, and the remainder for validating the predictions (Methods 2.3).” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 9)
\par
“In general, microbial data can also classify other associated features with geolocation, like elevation, coastal association, and climate. To confirm this, we also tested classification with LOGO, where we also saw some features like surface material (coarse) outperforming k-fold validation.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 9)
\par
“In general, we found that we were able to predict all taxon levels, with a precision and recall of greater than 65\% (Figure 4), including Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). For class, genus, and OTU, the accuracy was greater than 80\%. We then used OTUs to train Cassandra, which achieved 86.5\% accuracy (the top 15 bioindicators’ OTUs are depicted in Figure 4B).” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 9)
\par
“This investigation demonstrates that, even from varied mixtures of microbial communities, we can uniquely predict the provenance of a given metagenomic sample by its microbial fingerprint.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 12)
\par
“Deploying the MetaSUB protocol [4], we were able to classify the continent and city of origin from a given WGS metagenomic sample from the global dataset, with 94\% and 89\% accuracy, respectively, and the sea or ocean of origin with 83\% accuracy when using OTUs from the Tara Oceans dataset.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 12)
\par
“Species classified by Cassandra can be further used to monitor pathogenic outbreaks as well as the spread of” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 12)
\par
“AMR using additional resources. Databases like Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) [49], TerrestrialMetagenomeDB [50], and Microbe Directory (MD2) [51] can be used as ancillary information for defining phenotypes, and other attributes of the bioindicators species [52].” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 13)
\par
“Further applications include tracking the microbiome before and after exposure to diseases like SARS COV2 [57], and determining changes in the microibial composition following dietary alterations [58–60].” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 13)
\par
“However, such use requires caution, as it could contribute to errors, socioeconomic discrimination, or stigmatization, and the results would need to be verified, as with all other methods in forensics. Nonetheless, the tools, data, and methods are finally emerging to make such methods of tracking and provenance a reality.” (Bhattacharya et al., 2022, p. 13)},

One thousand six hundred and twenty male Ross 380 broilers (one-day-old, body weight, 42 ± 0.5 g and 5-week trial) were arbitrarily chosen and assigned to three nutritive treatments (basal diet and basal diet included with 0.1\%, and 0.2\% probiotic mixture [Bacillus subtilis 7.0 × 107 cfu/g, Bacillus licheniformis 4.1 × 107 cfu/g]) with 30 duplicates (18 birds each).

In the first study, three treatments were used: Unchallenged Control (UC); Challenged Control (CC; dietary challenge and 10× dose of coccidia vaccine); and a challenged group supplemented with PB (1.3 kg/ton). In the second study, three treatments were used: control diet, diet supplemented with Avilamycin (10 ppm), and a diet supplemented with PB (0.9 kg/ton). All the birds were exposed to natural challenge composed by dietary formulation and reused litter from a coccidiosis positive flock. In Trial 1, PB decreased ileal histological damage, increased villi length, and the expression of SLC5A8 in ileal tissue versus CC; it reduced ileal expression of IL-1β compared to both UC and CC treatments. PB increased the expression of cell cycling gene markers CCNA2 and CDK2 in the ileum compared to CC. In Trial 2, PB improved the growth performance, intestinal lesion scores and intestinal morphology of broiler chickens. These results indicate that birds supplemented with PB are more resilient to enteric challenges, probably by its action in modulating microbiome metabolic pathways related to nitrogen metabolism and protein utilization.},

"The first is the existence of core microbiome pathways for energy, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism across microorganisms [6].

\par
"The latter property lies in stark contrast to taxonomic composition (e.g., the gut microbial profile), which often varies significantly across a population of otherwise similar individuals [7]. These insights suggest that targeting core microbiome pathways, rather than working to adjust the microbial profile, offers the potential for improved consistency [4]."

"One strategy for developing PB is by screening tailored glycans for their ability to modulate selected microbiome pathways across a diverse set of microbial communities [8,9].

"This close symbiotic relationship has given way to the idea of the holo-biont, as an organism composed of the host and its microbiome [14].

  abstract = {Broiler leg diseases are a common abnormal bone metabolism issue that leads to poor leg health in growing poultry. Bone metabolism is a complicated regulatory process controlled by genetic, nutritional, feeding management, environmental, or other influencing factors. The gut microbiota constitutes the largest micro-ecosystem in animals and is closely related to many metabolic disorders, including bone disease, by affecting the absorption of nutrients and the barrier function of the gastrointestinal tract and regulating the immune system and even the brain–gut–bone axis. Recently, probiotic-based dietary supplementation has emerged as an emerging strategy to improve bone health in chickens by regulating bone metabolism based on the gut–bone axis. This review aims to summarize the regulatory mechanisms of probiotics in the gut microbiota on bone metabolism and to provide new insights for the prevention and treatment of bone diseases in broiler chickens.},

  abstract = {The current study was performed to explore the effects of dietary supplementation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae hydrolysate (SCH) on growth performance, immune function, and intestinal health in broiler chicken. A total of 300 Ross 308 male broilers (1-day-old) were randomly assigned to 2 dietary treatments including a basal diet (control group), and a basal diet supplemented with SCH feed additive (500 mg/kg in starter and grower phase, and 250 mg/kg in finisher phase). Each treatment had 6 replicates with 25 birds each. The results showed that the addition of SCH promoted growth during d 15 to 28 (P {$<$} 0.05). Although the addition of SCH had no significant effect on the intestinal relative indexes, it significantly increased the jejunum villus height (VH) and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (VCR) of jejunum, and decreased the crypt depth (CD) of ileum (P {$<$} 0.05). Furthermore, SCH addition significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of immunomodulatory genes (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), and upregulated the tight junction genes (ZO-1 and Claudin-1) (P {$<$} 0.05). High throughput sequencing analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA revealed that dietary SCH supplementation altered cecum microbiota. Alpha diversity analysis showed that a higher bacterial richness in cecum of broilers fed with SCH. The composition of cecum microbiota regulated by SCH addition was characterized by an increased abundance of Firmicutes and a reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes. At the genus level, dietary SCH resulted in a decrease of Bacteroides and an increase of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) -producing bacteria including Lactobacillus and Faecalibacterium. Taken together, dietary SCH supplementation can stimulate the growth of broilers by regulating the intestinal immunity and barrier function, and improving the intestinal morphology, which may be related to the enhancement of bacterial diversity and the changes of intestinal microbial composition.},

  abstract = {It is known that data from both 16S and shotgun metagenomics studies are subject to biases that cause the observed relative abundances of taxa to differ from their true values. Model community analyses, in which the relative abundances of all taxa in the sample are known by construction, seem to offer the hope that these biases can be measured. However, it is unclear whether the bias we measure in a mock community analysis is the same as we measure in a sample in which taxa are spiked in at known relative abundance, or if the biases we measure in spike-in samples is the same as the bias we would measure in a real (e.g., biological) sample. Here, we consider these questions in the context of 16S rRNA measurements on three sets of samples: the commercially available Zymo cells model community; the Zymo model community mixed with Swedish Snus, a smokeless tobacco product that is virtually bacteria-free; and a set of commercially available smokeless tobacco products. Each set of samples was subject to four different extraction protocols. The goal of our analysis is to determine whether the patterns of bias observed in each set of samples are the same, i.e., can we learn about the bias in the commercially available smokeless tobacco products by studying the Zymo cells model community?},

  abstract = {Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a gastro-intestinal (GI) infection that illustrates how perturbations in symbiotic host–microbiome interactions render the GI tract vulnerable to the opportunistic pathogens. CDI also serves as an example of how such perturbations could be reversed via gut microbiota modulation mechanisms, especially fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). However, microbiome-mediated diagnosis of CDI remains understudied. Here, we evaluated the diagnostic capabilities of the fecal microbiome on the prediction of CDI. We used the metagenomic sequencing data from ten previous studies, encompassing those acquired from CDI patients treated by FMT, CDI-negative patients presenting other intestinal health conditions, and healthy volunteers taking antibiotics. We designed a hybrid species/function profiling approach that determines the abundances of microbial species in the community contributing to its functional profile. These functionally informed taxonomic profiles were then used for classification of the microbial samples. We used logistic regression (LR) models using these features, which showed high prediction accuracy (with an average AUC≥0.91), substantiating that the species/function composition of the gut microbiome has a robust diagnostic prediction of CDI. We further assessed the confounding impact of antibiotic therapy on CDI prediction and found that it is distinguishable from the CDI impact. Finally, we devised a log-odds score computed from the output of the LR models to quantify the likelihood of CDI in a gut microbiome sample and applied it to evaluating the effectiveness of FMT based on post-FMT microbiome samples. The results showed that the gut microbiome of patients exhibited a gradual but steady improvement after receiving successful FMT, indicating the restoration of the normal microbiome functions.},

In this paper, the indigenous intestinal bacteria and the microbial fermentation profile particularly short chain fatty acids (SCFA), lactate, and ammonia concentrations are reviewed. The intestinal bacterial composition changes with age. The bacterial density of the small intestine increases with age and comprises of lactobacilli, streptococci, enterobacteria, fusobacteria and eubacteria. Strict anaerobes (anaerobic gram-positive cocci, Eubacterium spp., Clostridium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Bacteroides) are predominating caecal bacteria in young broilers. Data from culture-based studies showed that bifidobacteria could not be isolated from young birds, but were recovered from four-week-old broilers. Caecal lactobacilli accounted for 1.5 – 24\% of the caecal bacteria. Gene sequencing of caecal DNA extracts showed that the majority of bacteria belonged to Clostridiaceae. Intestinal bacterial community is influenced by the dietary ingredients, nutrient levels and physical structure of feed. SCFA and other metabolic products are affected by diet formulation and age. Additional studies are required to know the bacterial metabolic activities together with the community analysis of the intestinal bacteria. Feed composition and processing have great potential to influence the activities of intestinal bacteria towards a desired direction in order to support animal health, well-being and microbial safety of broiler meat.},

  abstract = {Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) can identify affected but asymptomatic infants. The selection of omic technique for gut microbiota study is crucial due to both the small amount of feces available and the low microorganism load. Our aims were to compare the agreement between 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and metaproteomics by a robust statistical analysis, including both presence and abundance of taxa, to describe the sequential establishment of the gut microbiota during the first year of life in a small size sample (8 infants and 28 fecal samples). The taxonomic assignations by the two techniques were similar, whereas certain discrepancies were observed in the abundance detection, mostly the lower predicted relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and the higher predicted relative abundance of certain Firmicutes and Proteobacteria by amplicon sequencing. During the first months of life, the CF gut microbiota is characterized by a significant enrichment of Ruminococcus gnavus, the expression of certain virulent bacterial traits, and the detection of human inflammation-related proteins. Metaproteomics provides information on composition and functionality, as well as data on host-microbiome interactions. Its strength is the identification and quantification of Actinobacteria and certain classes of Firmicutes, but alpha diversity indices are not comparable to those of amplicon sequencing. Both techniques detected an aberrant microbiota in our small cohort of infants with CF during their first year of life, dominated by the enrichment of R. gnavus within a human inflammatory environment. IMPORTANCE In recent years, some techniques have been incorporated for the study of microbial ecosystems, being 16S rRNA gene sequencing being the most widely used. Metaproteomics provides the advantage of identifying the interaction between microorganisms and human cells, but the available databases are less extensive as well as imprecise. Few studies compare the statistical differences between the two techniques to define the composition of an ecosystem. Our work shows that the two methods are comparable in terms of microorganism identification but provide different results in alpha diversity analysis. On the other hand, we have studied newborns with cystic fibrosis, for whom we have described the establishment of an intestinal ecosystem marked by the inflammatory response of the host and the enrichment of Ruminococcus gnavus.},

It is of interest to understand the impacts and colonization rates of               Salmonella               across selected genetic lines such as slow-growing (SG) and conventional (CONV) broilers. The objective of this study was to characterize the relationship between               Salmonella enterica               serovar Typhimurium challenge and selected broiler genetic lines on the ileal and cecal microbiome. Male chicks of two broiler breeds (               n               = 156/breed) were cohoused in an open floor pen until day 7. On day 13, the chicks were then separated into 12 isolators per breed (4 rooms, 6 isolators/room, 11 chicks/isolator). On day 14, chicks in the 12 treatment isolators (6 isolators/breed, 108 total) were challenged with               Salmonella               Typhimurium (ST) (1 ×                                                                                                                        10                                              8                                                                                       CFU/ml) via oral gavage while the remaining chicks (               n               = 108) were given an oral gavage of sterile tryptic soy broth control (C). Ileal and cecal contents were collected on day 7 from 24 chicks of each breed, and on days 13, 17, 21, and 24 from two chicks per isolator. Samples underwent DNA extraction and PCR amplification to obtain 16S rRNA amplicons that were sequenced with Illumina MiSeq.               Salmonella               Typhimurium colonization in the cecum was not different in the two broiler breeds. The main effect of breed had the greatest impact on the ileum microbiota of broilers 7~days of age where SG broilers had significantly lower diversity and richness compared to CONV broilers (               p               \&lt; 0.05).               Salmonella               Typhimurium challenge consistently caused a change in beta diversity. Regardless of day or intestinal location, challenged broilers had many amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with decreased abundance of likely beneficial bacteria such as               Mollicutes               RF39,               Shuttleworthia               ,               Flavonifractor               , and               Oscillibacter               compared to broilers that were unchallenged with               Salmonella               Typhimurium (               p               \&lt; 0.05). Additionally, there was a difference in the timing of when the microbiota alpha and beta diversity of each breed responded to               Salmonella               Typhimurium challenge. Thus, both broiler breed and               Salmonella               Typhimurium can impact the intestinal microbiota.},

Flavonifractor is positively correlated with body weight and average daily gain in broilers given Bacillus subtilis as a probiotic (Zhang et al., 2021).

Chickens harbour unique and diverse bacterial communities that include human and animal pathogens. Increasing public concern about the use of antibiotics in the poultry industry has influenced the ways in which poultry producers are working towards improving birds’ intestinal health. Effective means of antibiotic-independent pathogen control through competitive exclusion and promotion of good protective microbiota are being actively investigated. With the realisation that just about any change in environment influences the highly responsive microbial communities and with the abandonment of the notion that we can isolate and investigate a single species of interest outside of the community, came a flood of studies that have attempted to profile the intestinal microbiota of chickens under numerous conditions. This review aims to address the main issues in investigating chicken microbiota and to summarise the data acquired to date.},

  abstract = {Avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), one of the widespread zoonotic-pathogen, can cause a series of diseases collectively known as colibacillosis. This disease can cause thousands of million dollars economic loss each year in poultry industry and threaten to human health via meat or egg contamination. However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying APEC infection is still not fully understood. Circular RNAs, a new type of endogenous noncoding RNA, have been demonstrated to involve in various biological processes. However, it is still not clear whether the circRNAs participate in host response against APEC infection. Herein, we utilized the high-throughput sequence technology to identify the circRNA expression profiles in APEC infected HD11 cells. A total of 49 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs were detected in the comparison of APEC infected HD11 cells vs. wild type HD11 cells, which were involved in MAPK signaling pathway, Endocytosis, Focal adhesion, mTOR signaling pathway, and VEGF signaling pathway. Specifically, the source genes (BRAF, PPP3CB, BCL2L13, RAB11A, and TSC2) and their corresponding DE circRNAs may play a significant role in APEC infection. Moreover, based on ceRNA regulation, we constructed the circRNA-miRNA network and identified a couple of important regulatory relationship pairs related to APEC infection, including circRAB11A-gga-miR-125b-3p, circRAB11A-gga-miR-1696, and circTSC2-gga-miR-1649-5p. Results indicate that the aforementioned specific circRNAs and circRNA-miRNA network might have important role in regulating host immune response against APEC infection. This study is the first time to investigate the circRNAs expression profile and the biological function of the source genes of the identified DE circRNAs after APEC infection of chicken HD11 cells. These results would contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms in host response against APEC infection.},

  abstract = {In shotgun metagenomics (SM), the state-of-the-art bioinformatic workflows are referred to as high-resolution shotgun metagenomics (HRSM) and require intensive computing and disk storage resources. While the increase in data output of the latest iteration of high-throughput DNA sequencing systems can allow for unprecedented sequencing depth at a minimal cost, adjustments in HRSM workflows will be needed to properly process these ever-increasing sequence datasets. One potential adaptation is to generate so-called shallow SM datasets that contain fewer sequencing data per sample as compared with the more classic high coverage sequencing. While shallow sequencing is a promising avenue for SM data analysis, detailed benchmarks using real-data are lacking. In this case study, we took four public SM datasets, one massive and the others moderate in size and subsampled each dataset at various levels to mimic shallow sequencing datasets of various sequencing depths. Our results suggest that shallow SM sequencing is a viable avenue to obtain sound results regarding microbial community structures and that high-depth sequencing does not bring additional elements for ecological interpretation. More specifically, results obtained by subsampling as little as 0.5~M sequencing clusters per sample were similar to the results obtained with the largest subsampled dataset for human gut and agricultural soil datasets. For an Antarctic dataset, which contained only a few samples, 4~M sequencing clusters per sample was found to generate comparable results to the full dataset. One area where ultra-deep sequencing and maximizing the usage of all data was undeniably beneficial was in the generation of metagenome-assembled genomes.},

  abstract = {16S rRNA gene sequencing for characterization of microbiomes has become more common in poultry research and can be used to both answer specific research questions and help inform experimental design choices. The objective of this study was to use 16S rRNA gene sequencing to examine common sampling practices in broiler chicken studies such as: the required number of birds selected from a flock to adequately capture microbiome diversity, the differences between cecal pairs within the same bird, and whether cloacal swabs are representative of other alimentary tract (AT) locations. To do this, nine market age broilers were euthanized and immediately sampled in ten AT locations: crop, gizzard, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecal samples from each pouch, colon, and cloacal swab. DNA was extracted and subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. Each location within the broiler AT hosts distinct microbial communities. When each sampling location was considered, it was found that sampling after 2.8 birds (range 2–4) resulted in less than 10\% new amplicon sequencing variants (ASV) being added while sampling after 7.6 birds (range 6–10) increases new observed ASVs by less than 1\%. Additionally, when cecal pairs from the same bird were evaluated, it was found that cecal pair mates are an adequate replication if interested in the total cecal microbiome but may be less useful if a rare lineage is of interest. Furthermore, when compared to other AT locations, the cecal microbiome was enriched in Firmicutes and Bacteroides while several lineages, most notably Lactobacillus, were under-represented. Finally, when cloacal swabs were compared to other AT locations, community similarity exhibited a direct distance relationship, i.e., the more aborad samples were the more similar they were to the swab. These findings indicate that while cloacal swabs can approximate overall changes in microbiome composition, they are not adequate for inferring changes to specific taxa in other parts of the AT tract—even those that are highly abundant within the microbial community. These data provide new insights guiding appropriate sample size selection within flocks and add to the consensus data regarding cecal pair similarity and destructive versus non-destructive sampling methods.},

  abstract = {Ammonia is a toxic air pollutant that causes severe respiratory tract injury in animals and humans. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been found to be involved in the development of respiratory tract injury induced by air pollutants, however, the specific mechanism requires investigation. Here, we found that, inhaled ammonia induced tracheal injury by reducing expression of claudin-1, increasing expression of muc5ac, TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10), and also altering tracheal microbiota composition. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that gut microbiota dysbiosis positively correlated with TLR4 level in the trachea. Antibiotic depletion intestinal microbiota treatment reduced the severity of ammonia-induced tracheal injury via TLR4 signaling pathway. Microbiota transplantation induced the tracheal injury via TLR4 signaling pathway even without the ammonia exposure. These results indicate that gut microbiota dysbiosis exaggerates ammonia-induced tracheal injury via TLR4 signaling pathway. In addition, the [Ruminococcus]\_torques\_group, Faecalibacterium, unclassified\_f\_Lachnospiraceae may be the key gut microbiota contributing to the alterations of tracheal microbiota composition.},
