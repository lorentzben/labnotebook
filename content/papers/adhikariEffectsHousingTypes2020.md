“At phylum level, Actinobacteria was significantly enriched in W36 at all time points while Synergistetes (53 weeks), Spirochaetes (58 weeks), and Synergistetes and Spirochaetes (67 weeks) were significantly higher in HB” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 1) 

“The effect of housing and strains was not only seen at the bacterial composition and structure but also reflected at their functional level. Notably, KEGG metabolic pathways predicted to be involved in carbohydrates degradation and amino acids biosynthesis by PICRUSt analysis were significantly different between W36 and HB housed at CC and EC. In sum, cecal microbiota composition, diversities, and their functional pathways were affected by housing type which further varied between two commercial laying hen strains, HB and W36. This suggests that both housing and genetic strains of laying hens should be considered for selection of the alternative housing systems such as enriched colony cage.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 1) 

“IMPORTANCE” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2) This is an interesting section 

“Although previous studies have investigated the performance parameters and welfare of laying hens housed in CC and EC cages, there is very limited information regarding the changes in gut microbiota, particularly in ceca. Our research findings will be important to the primary breeders to help in the decision-making process to select certain types of breed for the specific housing environmen” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2) 

“Poultry industry is the fastest-growing industry which is expected to grow continuously since the demand for meat and eggs is continuously increasing as a result of growing human population (1).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2) Its always about: feeding the world 

“Traditionally, people focused mainly on the strategies to maximize the profit and productivity of poultry, and conventional cage (CC) system is one of those strategies developed during the 1930s and has been used in the traditional egg production since 1950s (3)” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2) 

“The negative impacts of CC are mainly due to the limited space for movement that can cause musculoskeletal weakness, and low complexities of the environment, which can abolish many of their natural behaviors such as nesting, roosting, dust bathing, perching, and foraging (6–8).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2) 

“As an alternative, enriched colony cages (CC) were developed that provide more space for movement and comfort behaviors, and may allow for some dust bathing, nesting, foraging, and perching (11)” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2) 

“Furthermore, it has been shown that host factors such as breeds or strains within the same environment can affect the intestinal microbiota in chicken (13).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2) 

“Hens were reared in top two tiers of three-tiered A-frame type conventional cage (CC; dimension: 1.6′ x 2′) and both tiers of two-tired enriched colony cage (EC; dimension: 4′ x 12′; Chore-Time Inc.,) at Mississippi State University Poultry Research Farm located in Starkville, MS.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2) 

“The design was completely randomized with 2×2 factorial arrangement of hen strain and cage environment” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2) 

“At 53, 58, 67, and 72 weeks of age, six hens per group were humanely euthanized with CO2” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 2) 

“V4 region of 16S rRNA gene” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 3) 

“from genomic DNA of each sample was amplified using the primers 515F (14) and 806R (15)” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 3) 

“One way ANOVA was used to analyze egg production data using SAS 9.2 version. Mean separation was performed using Fisher’s Protected LSD. A statistical P-value of either less or equal to 0.05 was considered significant.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 3) 

“Nebula cloud computing platform of the University of Arkansas was used to process raw sequencing reads in QIIME 2 versio” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 3) 

“2018.8 (17) utilizing the pipelines developed for paired-end data types. In sum, “demux emp-paired” method of q2-demux plugin was used to demultiplex sequencing reads followed by quality filtering and denoising with “dada2 denoise-paired” method of q2-dada2 (18) plugin available at QIIME 2. The truncation length of forward and reverse reads was set at 240 and 200 bp, respectively, which is based on the quality score criteria (≥30). Taxonomic assignments was performed using a Naive Bayes classifier (19) pre-trained with Greengenes (Version 13.8) 99% OTUs (20) and q2-feature-classifier plugin, where the sequences have been trimmed to include only the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene bound by the 515F/806R primer pair. The coremetrics-phylogenetic method at a sampling depth of 31,060 was used to analyze Alpha and Beta diversity. Shannon’s diversity index (21) and UnWeighted UniFrac distance metric (22) were used to calculate alpha and beta diversity, respectively. All figures including Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) plot were created from ggplot2 package of R (23).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 4) 

“pre-trained with Greengenes (Version 13.8) 99% OTUs (20” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 4) Why do you use green genes? 

“Statistical differences among treatment groups at different taxonomic assignments were calculated using LEfSe (24) using criteria, P &lt; 0.05, LDA score &gt; 2.0. While comparing taxa between two hen strains, hen strains were used as Class and Housing types were used as subclass. Likewise, Housing types were used as Class and hen strains as subclass while comparing taxa between housing types. The significant differences in alpha diversity were calculated using the alpha-group-significance command of QIIME2 which uses Kruskal-Wallis test. On the contrary, statistical differences in beta diversity among groups were calculated by PERMANOVA test (25) using the beta-groupsignificance command of QIIME2 with pairwise comparison option. For both diversity analyses, the corrected P-values for multiple comparisons (q) were used to report a significant difference between two groups, where the level of significance was set at q &lt; 0.05. PICRUSt2 (26) was used to predict the metabolic pathways of cecal microbiota, and MetaCyc database (27) was used to describe the predicted pathways. Differentially” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 4) 

“abundant features were identified using Welch’s t-test built-in STAMP software (28), where features were filtered using P &lt; 0.05 and difference in mean proportions (%) &lt;0.03 criteria.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 5) 

“Summarization of the feature table resulted in 5,568,578 sequence reads from 90 samples that ranged from 31,060 to 88,097 reads per sample. The median and mean±SE reads per sample were 63,893.50 and 61,873.09 ± 1,270.94, respectively. In addition, there were altogether 1,759 unique features (amplicon sequence variants) from these 90 samples. The summary of average reads per sample in different groups is summarized in Table 2.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 5) 

“Taking consideration of all samples, 99.36% of total sequence reads were assigned to 15 different bacterial phyla, while 0.63%” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 5) 

“of total sequence reads were assigned to domain Archaea.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 5) 

“In addition, 0.01% of total sequence reads were assigned to Kingdom Bacteria but not to the lower level of the taxonomy. Among those phyla, Bacteroidetes (49.05%) was the predominant phylum followed by Firmicutes (45.05%). Other important phyla with relative abundance greater than 0.2% included Actinobacteria (2.70%), Proteobacteria (0.77%), Spirochaetes (0.52%), Synergistetes (0.41%), and WPS-2 (0.34%). The relative abundance levels of major phyla that were presented in two different housing types at four different time points are shown in Figure 1” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 5) 

“The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was the highest followed by Firmicutes in both HB and W36 irrespective of housing types and ages, except in W36 hens housed in CC housing at 67 weeks where the Firmicutes (51.96%) was found as the predominant phylum (Figure 1). Likewise, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria was found higher especially in W36 irrespective of housing as shown in Figure 1” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 5) 

“The phylum Actinobacteria was significantly enriched in W36 group throughout all four different ages as compared to the HB group” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 5) 

“However, the phyla Synergistetes and Spirochaetes were significantly abundant in HB group at 53 and 58 weeks, respectively, and both Synergistetes and Spirochaetes at 67 weeks as compared to W36.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 5) 

“At 72 weeks, no significant difference was observed at any phyla between HB and W36 groups.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 5) 

“Regarding housing effects, the phylum” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 5) 

“Spirochaetes was significantly higher in EC group in both 53 and 58 weeks as compared to CC.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 6) 

“On the contrary, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were significantly enriched in EC and CC group, respectively, at 67 weeks.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 6) 

“At 72 weeks, Proteobacteria was significantly higher in EC as compared to CC group.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 6) 

“Out of 99.36% of total sequence reads that were assigned to one of the bacterial phyla, 68.45% were properly assigned to one of the 89 bacterial genera while taking account of all samples.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 6) 

“The remaining reads were assigned to higher level of bacterial taxa” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 6) 

“such as family, order, class, and phylum” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 6) 

“Among those genera, Bacteroides (17.60%) was the predominant genus, followed by Prevotella (10.20%), Ruminococcus (7.91%), Lactobacillus (4.83%), Fecalibacterium (3.60%), Phascolarctobacterium (3.41%) and Megamonas (3.37%). Other notable genera included Coprococcus, Blautia, Peptococcus, genus S24-7, and Turicibacter whose relative abundance ranged from 1.21 to 1.91%.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 6) 

“Bacteroides that ranged from 13.57% (EC-W36 at 53 weeks) to 21.69% (CC-HB at 58 weeks) was the predominant genus in both hen strains housed in either CC or EC except in” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 6) 

“W36 housed at EC at 53 and 58 weeks, where Prevotella (16.13%) and Lactobacillus (15.65%) were the predominant genera in respective ages (Figure 2). The relative abundance of Prevotella ranged from 5.49 to 9.78% in HB (Figure 2; left half), whereas it ranged from 8.62 to 16.13% in W36 (Figure 2; right half)” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 7) 

“Similarly, the relative abundance of Ruminococcus ranged from 4.83 to 9.75% in HB, while it ranged from 5.93 to 9.84% in W36” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 7) 

“In addition, Lactobacillus ranged from 2.59 to 4.72% in HB, but it ranged from 2.35 to 15.65% in W36. Another important observation was the genus Megamonas which was found the highest (13.75%) in W36 housed at 67 weeks in CC housing.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 7) 

“The strain effect was more pronounced than housing effect, and the bacterial taxa that were differentially abundant between W36 and HB strains at 53, 58, 67, and 72 weeks are shown in Figures 3–6, respectively” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 7) 

“The genus Bifidobacterium was significantly enriched in W36 as compared to HB throughout all time points. In addition, Butyricicoccus (except, 67 weeks), unidentified genera of phylum Actinobacteria (except, 67 weeks), Bulleidia and Pseudoramibacter-Eubacterium (except 72 weeks) were significantly higher in W36 at all time points. Other notable genera that were significantly abundant in W36 were Candidatus Arthromitus (except 58 and 67 weeks) and Subdoligranulum (except 53 and 67 weeks) as shown in Figures 3–6. Moreover, Prevotella, Collinsella, Flexispira, and Slackia were presented significantly higher in W36 only at 58 weeks (Figure 4), whereas Succinatimonas was presented significantly higher only at 72 weeks (Figure 6” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 7) 

“In addition, the genus Akkermansia, and the unidentified genera that belong to phylum Synergistetes, and that belong to family Christensenellaceae were also significantly higher in HB at all time points except at 72 weeks” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 7) 

“Interestingly, some of the archaeal taxa were also found to be differentially presented between two strains of laying hens throughout all time points except at 72 weeks. Methanobrevibacter and 3 unknown genera that were assigned as Methanobacteria, Methanobacteriales, and Methanobacteriaceae, respectively, were significantly higher in W36 at 53 and 58 weeks, while unknown genera that were assigned as Methanomicrobia, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanocorpusculaceae were significantly higher in HB (except 72 weeks)” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 7) 

“The bacterial genus Treponema and the unknown genera of order” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 8) 

“Spirochaetales, Spirochaetes, and Spirochaetes were significantly enriched in EC as compared to CC at both 53 and 58 weeks.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 8) 

“On the contrary, Campylobacter and other unknown genera of family Campylobacteraceae were significantly higher in EC at both 67 and 72 weeks. In addition, bacterial genera such as Ruminococcus, Corynebacterium, Sutterella, and the unknown genera that were assigned at order Burkholderiales and Actinomycetales, and family Corynebacteriaceae and Alcaligenaceae were significantly abundant in EC at 53 weeks.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 8) 

“The alpha diversity was highly affected by strains in comparison to housing. The alpha diversities in HB strain was significantly higher as compared to W36 throughout all four ages as shown in Figure 14. The alpha diversity increased with increase in age of both strains which was more noticeable in HB, where the alpha diversity of HB strain at 72 weeks was significantly higher in comparison to HB at 53 weeks of age as shown in Figure 11.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 10) 

“Similarly, as age of birds increased, the alpha diversity also increased in both housing types with more pronounced increase in EC housing, where the alpha diversity of birds at 67 weeks was significantly higher as compared to those at 53 weeks as shown in” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 10) 

“Figure 12.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 11) 

“The PERMANOVA results showed that the microbial community structure in laying hens was significantly affected by all three variable analyzed; age (P = 0.028), housing (P = 0.001), and strain (P = 0.001).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 11) 

“Pairwise PERMANOVA results showed that there was a tendency of microbial community structure difference between EC and CC throughout four ages, significant difference between EC and CC was observed only at 67 weeks of age. This is in accordance with the results in alpha diversity.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 11) 

“Furthermore, in agreement with taxonomic composition and alpha diversity, the strain effect was most prominent on beta diversity among other variables since there was significant difference in beta diversity between HB and W36 throughout all four ages (adjusted P &lt; 0.05).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 11) 

“On the contrary to housing, increase in age resulted in significant difference in beta diversity even within the same strains, which was more noticeable in HB (53 vs. 67, 58 vs. 67 and 72, and 67 vs. 72) than W36 (53 vs. 67).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 11) 

“Moreover, the cecal microbiota community structure was affected by housing types in both HB (Figure 14) and W36 hens (Figure 15) at P &lt; 0.00” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 11) 

“age, housing, and strain not only affected community diversity but also affected the functional diversity of cecal microbiota (P &lt; 0.001).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12) 

“On the contrary, housing types affected functional diversity more than the community structure, where there was significant difference in functional diversity between CC and EC at both 67 and 72 weeks (PERMANOVA pairwise, P &lt; 0.05).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12) 

“Among 17 differentially abundant pathways between HB and W36, 13 pathways were significantly enriched in W36 while 4 pathways were significantly enriched in HB” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12) 

“In W36, metabolic pathways related to TCA cycle, sucrose degradation, hexitol fermentation (lactate, formate, and ethanol), amino” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12) 

“acids biosynthesis (arginine, L-phenylalanine, and L-tyrosine), the Bifidobacterium shunt, and peptidoglycan biosynthesis were significantly enriched in W36. On the other hand, pathways related to pyruvate fermentation to acetone, and biotin synthesis, palmitate biosynthesis were highly abundant in HB (Figure 17).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12) 

“In HB group, altogether 22 metabolic pathways (8 in CC and 14 in EC) were differentially presented between CC and EC housing systems after filtering pathways with P &gt; 0.05 (Welch’s t-test) and effect size (% difference in mean proportions) &lt;0.03 using STAMP (Figure 18).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12) 

“Specifically, pathways of TCA cycle, amino acid biosynthesis (L-serine and L-glycine), starch degradation, adenosylcobalamin (also known as vitamin B12 or coenzyme B12) biosynthesis, and 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin diphosphate biosynthesis (precursor of vitamin B9 synthesis) were significantly enriched in CC group, whereas pathways of glycerol degradation, methanogenesis, amino acid biosynthesis (L-lysine, L-threonine, L-methionine, and L-aspartate), and purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis were significantly enriched in EC group.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12) 

“W36 group, altogether 37 metabolic pathways (22 in CC and 15 in EC) were differentially presented between CC and EC housing systems as shown in Figure 1” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12) 

“Like in the HB group, pathways of TCA cycle and 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin diphosphate biosynthesis (precursor of vitamin B9 synthesis) were significantly higher in CC group, while pathways of purine nucleotide and amino acids (L-lysine and L-aspartate) biosynthesis in EC group. On the contrary, biosynthesis pathways of amino acids such as L-ornithine, L-tryptophan, L-arginine, L-tyrosine, L-histidine, and L-phenylalanine were significantly enriched in CC group.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12) 

“Another important observation was significant enrichment of glycolysis, acid fermentation and” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 12) 

“Bifidobacterium shunt pathway in EC group, while significant enrichment of pathways associated with various vitamins biosyntheses such as K2 (menaquinol-8 biosynthesis) and B12 (tetrapyrrole biosynthesis I) was observed in CC group (Figure 19).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13) 

“In laying hens, different dietary supplementations such as threonine (29), rapeseed meal (30), probiotics (31–33), calcium (34), and flaxseed oil (35) have been found to modulate the intestinal microbiota. However, there is very limited information regarding the changes in intestinal microbiota composition of laying hens due to the housing systems.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13) 

“In the present study, we found changes in cecal microbiota composition, their diversities and predicted functional pathways in both laying hen strains raised in CC and EC housing systems during the late production stage.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13) 

“A previous study reported a higher number of Clostridium perfringens in ileum and cecum of broiler chickens raised on organic farms as compared to the conventional farms was observed (36)” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13) 

“lower count of C. perfringens in conventional farms might be achieved due to the application of Salinomycin in the conventional feed that has antibiotic properties. In addition, they found an increase in Lactobacilli, while a decrease in Enterobacteriaceae counts in the ileal contents of the chickens from organic farms (36).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13) 

“Another study reported enrichment of Bifidobacterium in both ileum and ceca of broiler chickens which were provided free daytime access to outdoor space as compared to those chickens which were kept at indoors range (37).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13) 

“Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was higher in cecum of cage-raised chickens, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes was higher in free-range chickens (38).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13) 

“we also reported the higher abundance of Bacteroidetes in EC where hens have more flexibility in movement and behavioral expression, while the higher abundance of Firmicutes in CC where they have restricted movement, especially at 67 weeks of age. In addition, we also reported significantly higher abundance of Proteobacteria in EC at 72 weeks of age in CC and EC.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13) 

“Many gramnegative pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Helicobacter, and Vibrio belong to the phylum Proteobacteria whose increase can be considered as a potential indicator of gut dysbiosis (39).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13) 

“This was also reflected at the genus level where Campylobacter and unknown genera of family Campylobacteraceae and Helicobacteraceae were significantly higher in EC at 72 weeks.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13) 

“More specifically, the alpha diversity was decreased in chickens housed in cages as compared to those from free-range. In addition, most of the KEGG pathways of cecal microbiota associated with various functions such as metabolism, alkaloid biosynthesis, and amino acids degradation were down-regulated in cages-reared chickens.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 14) 

“Likewise, several metabolic pathways were differentially enriched between CC and EC in the current study, which were further dependent on laying hen strains. For instance, 22 metabolic pathways (8 in CC and 14 in EC) were differentially abundant in HB strain, while 37 metabolic pathways (22 in CC and 15 in EC) in W36 strain, suggesting more pronounced effects of housing in W36.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 14) 

“Specifically, pathways related to energy and nucleotide metabolism, and amino acids and vitamin B biosynthesis were” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 14) 

“differentially presented between two housing systems in a straindependent manner.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 14) 

“The phylum Actinobacteria and its genus Bifidobacterium were significantly enriched in W36 as compared to the HB throughout all four-time points.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 14) 

“Specifically, bifidobacteria are well-known for their ability to ferment complex carbohydrates in the lower part of the intestine that bypasses the degradation in the upper parts through various carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (43). They can ferment diverse complex carbon sources including gastric mucin, (trans)-galactooligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, malto-oligosaccharides, fructo-oligosaccharides, pectin, soybean oligosaccharides, and other plant derived-oligosaccharides. However, their ability to degrade particular carbon source is species/strain-dependent (44). Through fermentation, bifidobacteria can degrade complex carbohydrates to monosaccharides which are further degraded to intermediates of the hexose fermentation pathway (also known as Bifidobacterium shunt or fructose-6-phosphate shunt) (45) and finally converted to short-chain fatty acids, especially acetate and lactate (42).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 14) Make a note of this " 

“the current study, carbohydrate degradation was significantly enriched in W36 as compared to the HB. In addition, the Bifidobacterium shunt pathway was significantly enriched” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 15) 

“in W36 as compared to the HB” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 15) 

“Similarly, butyrate-producing genera such as Butyricicoccus and Subdoligranulum were significantly higher in W36 as compared to HB at 58 and 72 weeks.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 16) 

“several beneficial effects such as improvement of performance parameters and maintenance of gut health by controlling the proliferation of bacterial pathogens and enhancement of intestinal development (47, 48).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 16) 

“Briefly, there were 36, 21, 54, and 7 differentially abundant genera between HB and W36 at 53, 58, 67, and 72 weeks, respectively.” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 16)
