### Abstract
Salmonella enteritidis is a foodborne pathogen that causes high morbidity in poultry. Proteomic analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to study the effects of Salmonella infection on spleen proteome in broiler chickens. Day-old broilers were assigned to control (CON; n = 60) or Salmonella challenge (CON−SE; n = 60), and gavaged with Tryptic soy agar broth or SE. A subset of chicks was euthanized on D3 and D7 (n = 4/group/day) and the spleen was removed, and rapidly frozen, subsequently proteome was measured using label-free LC-MS/MS. Protein spectra were mapped to Gallus gallus Uniprot database. Differentially abundant proteins (DAP; FDR < 0.05) between days and treatments were identified using ANOVA. Cecal content of Salmonella in CON−SE was 3.37 log10 CFU/g and CON were negative. Across the 16 samples, 2625 proteins were identified. Proteins that decreased in abundance between days mediated cell cycle progression, while those that increased in abundance function in cytoskeleton and mRNA processing. SE infection caused an increase in proteins that mediated redox homeostasis, lysosomal activities, and energy production, while proteins decreased in abundance-mediated developmental progression. Proteomic signatures of spleen suggest SE infection was metabolically costly, and energy was diverted from normal developmental processes to potentiate disease resistance mechanisms.

"Salmonella persistently infects poultry because of its high mass of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), high-density growth, and motility as well as its ability to thrive in notably harsh conditions such as high acidity and oxidative stress found in the gastrointestinal tract [5]. As a Gram-negative bacterium, SE possesses an outer protective cell wall that harbors several pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) which stimulate inflammation in a host [5]. Salmonella infections are initiated through oral ingestion and can result in intestinal colonization and the dissemination of lipopolysaccharide to internal organs through circulation including the spleen [6]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C5NKKAVD?page=1) )

"The spleen harbors T and B lymphocytes and as the main secondary lymphoid organ, it is the center for cellular and adaptive immunity, [7] thus infections can disrupt its normal functioning [8]. Also, maturation and storage of monocytes, B cells (mediator of humoral adaptive immunity), T cells (mediator of cellular adaptive immunity), and phagocytosis occur in the spleen. Broiler chicken challenge studies aimed at understanding the pathogenesis of Salmonella infection showed that infection induces inflammation associated with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the gut lumen [9], as well as an influx of heterophils into the gut lumen."
