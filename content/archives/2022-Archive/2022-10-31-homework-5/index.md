### Todos for Today:
- Homework 5
- continue reading jones
- Visualize Ampliseq
  - Refine chunk 06
  - add example params and slurm for ampliseq into ampliseq-vis repos
- nf-core/Ampliseq
  - compare low, medium, high richness results
- Term Paper
  - Collect reference genome and annotations
- re-watch the lecture for ChIP-seq
- What is a core microbiome?
  - Can we use this to find the major players in chicken gut segments?
  - are keystone species more important in gut microbiomes?
- How can multi-omics projects be implemented in host-microbe interactions
- Check in on classifier still running

    Shaile’s compare flip/flop and reply to his email

- BIOSQL, SQL or Mongo DB tutorials
- Genome Assembly from Isolates
- Kelly Shotgun Metagenomic Data
- good example 16s data to hone parameters

If I remember correctly we got report chunk 06 to render well, the main issue was that report 01 did not render images IN the HTML file but was still referencing external images. We should look into that too and confirm report 06 looks good too. Then it's homework, Shailes, and term paper time. We also have to examine the results from the ampliseq runs for low, medium and high ampliseq runs. 

I was able to complete the homework 5 assignment which was focused on using Kallisto and Sleuth for RNA-Seq differential expression. This will give me a good framework to look into for my term-paper in this class replicating results from my paper (which we should work on this week).
